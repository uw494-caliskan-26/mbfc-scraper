Now, she is publicly calling for the testimony to be in a public hearing rather than a closed-door deposition.\nHillary Clinton told the committee chair, Republican Rep.

They ignored all of it. They moved the goalposts and turned accountability into an exercise in distraction.\"\n\"So let's stop the games.

The only ones moving the goalposts are, as usual, the Clintons and their attorneys.\"\n\"The Clintons were issued bipartisan subpoenas for depositions — not a hearing. Republicans and Democrats on the Oversight Committee voted to recommend the House hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress for defying duly issued subpoenas for six months,\" the statement said.\n\"In the wake of facing contempt of Congress proceedings, the Clintons' attorney finally agreed to filmed, transcribed depositions on February 26 and 27,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\"These depositions are in accordance with House and Committee rules. All witnesses appearing for interviews as part of our Epstein investigation are being treated fairly and consistently. The Committee has filmed interviews with all witnesses, including former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr and U.S. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta — both of whom are Republican witnesses.\""

      "text": "Politics\nHillary Clinton Suffers ‘Public Outburst’ Over Subpoena For Epstein Testimony\nHillary Clinton is pushing back against House Republicans by demanding her upcoming testimony in the Jeffrey Epstein probe be held in public, turning a closed-door deposition into a potential political spectacle.\n“Let’s stop the games. If you want this fight, @RepJamesComer, let’s have it—in public,” Clinton wrote Thursday morning on X. “You love to talk about transparency. There’s nothing more transparent than a public hearing, cameras on. We will be there,” she added.\nThe former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee is scheduled to testify before the House Oversight Committee later this month as part of its investigation into ties between powerful political figures and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nHouse Oversight Chairman James Comer announced Tuesday that both Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, would appear after months of negotiations. Hillary Clinton is set to testify Feb. 26, with Bill Clinton following on Feb. 27.\nComer had planned closed-door depositions that would be transcribed and recorded. Clinton is now demanding that her testimony be given live and in full view of the public.\nIn a separate X post Thursday, Clinton said she and her husband had “engaged Republicans on the Oversight Committee in good faith” for six months and had already “told them what we know, under oath.” She accused the panel of shifting tactics, saying it “moved the goalposts and turned accountability into an exercise in distraction.”\nSo let’s stop the games.\nIf you want this fight, @RepJamesComer, let’s have it—in public.\nYou love to talk about transparency. There’s nothing more transparent than a public hearing, cameras on.\nWe will be there.\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 5, 2026\nThe hearings will mark the first time a former president has testified before Congress after being subpoenaed.\nPresident Donald Trump weighed in Wednesday, expressing discomfort with Congress targeting Bill Clinton, whom he described as a longtime acquaintance. “I think it’s a shame, to be honest. I always liked him,” Trump said during an Oval Office press conference. He also praised Hillary Clinton, calling her “a very capable woman” and “a smart woman.”\nComer, however, has signaled no retreat. In a statement Tuesday, he said, “Republicans and Democrats on the Oversight Committee have been clear: no one is above the law—and that includes the Clintons.”\nA potential contempt vote against the Clintons had been looming in the GOP-led House before they agreed to testify. That vote has since been shelved.\nComer said the pair “completely caved and will appear for transcribed, filmed depositions this month,” adding that lawmakers look forward to questioning them “to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people and for survivors” of Epstein’s crimes.\nClinton spokesman Angel Ureña said Monday that the Clintons “negotiated in good faith” and “look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone” with their testimony.\nThe showdown now centers on whether the Oversight Committee sticks to its closed-door plan or bows to Hillary Clinton’s demand to take the Epstein questions public.\nDownload the FREE Trending Politics App to get the latest news FIRST >>"

      "text": "‘Stop the games’: Hillary Clinton demands public hearing in Epstein probe\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is calling for her upcoming testimony before the House Oversight Committee to be made public in a congressional probe of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nIn a pair of social media posts on Feb. 5, the former first lady and Democratic presidential candidate railed against the committee and Republican lawmakers whom she said had “ignored” previous testimony by her and former President Bill Clinton.\nClinton said that they had engaged with the committee in “good faith,” but the goalposts kept moving in what she called “an exercise in distraction.”\n“We told them what we know, under oath,” Hillary Clinton said on X, alluding to their submitted sworn statements to the committee in January, mentioned in a widely circulated letter about the couple’s initual refusal to testify in person. “They ignored all of it.”\nHillary Clinton then challenged committee chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, to allow the nation to watch the Clintons’ testimony live.\n“Let’s stop the games. If you want this fight, @RepJamesComer, let’s have it – in public,” Hillary Clinton said. “You love to talk about transparency. There’s nothing more transparent than a public hearing, cameras on. We will be there.”\nHer comments come two days after Comer announced that the Clintons had “caved” and agreed to testify later this month as part of the committee’s investigation into Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislane Maxwell. The agreement came just days before a potential vote to hold the Clintons in contempt for refusing to appear before the committee.\n“Once it became clear that the House of Representatives would hold them in contempt, the Clintons completely caved and will appear for transcribed, filmed depositions this month,” Comer said in a Feb. 3 press release. “We look forward to questioning the Clintons as part of our investigation into the horrific crimes of Epstein and Maxwell, to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people and for survivors.”\nHillary Clinton is set to testify on Feb. 26, and the former president’s deposition will take place the following day, Feb. 27.\nTrump and Bill Clinton appear in Epstein records\nThe Epstein furor has dogged President Donald Trump, who was close friends with financial advisor Epstein for more than a decade during the 1990s and early 2000s. Epstein pleaded guilty to child prostitution-related charges in Florida in 2008 and died by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\nLast year, Trump signed a law he had initially opposed requring the Justice Department to release reams of investigative documents from its Epstein probes. Those and other disclosures have revealed Epstein’s ties to leading figures in politics, entertainment, and business − including Bill Clinton.\n“I think it’s really time for the country to maybe get onto something else,” Trump told reporters Feb 3. “Now that nothing came out about me, other than it was a conspiracy against me, literally by Epstein and other people.”\nTrump’s name, and that of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and other references to Trump appear 38,000 times across 5,300 files in the Justice Department’s Jan. 30 document release, according to a review by the New York Times. Several of the files appear to be duplicates, the news outlet reported.\nNeither Clinton nor Trump has been accused of criminal wrongdoing in their dealings with Epstein and Trump has vehemently denied wrongdoing in connection with his former friend.\nThe oversight committee initially issued subpoenas in August 2025 and scheduled appearances for January, but the Clintons defied them at that time.\nBill Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said on social media Feb. 2 that “the former President and former Secretary of State would be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nClintons change their tune about testifying\nThe Clintons’ reversal came less than a month after the couple defiantly said they would not participate in the “dismantling of America.” In a scathing Jan. 13 letter to Comer, the Clintons said the committee chair should be focused on preventing crimes like Epstein’s from happening again, but was instead playing “partisan politics.”\nThey had accused Comer of trying to embarrass them, calling the subpoenas “invalid and legally unenforceable,” and said they were prepared to state their case to the 45-member committee if necessary.\nNeither Clinton has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and both have said they do not know about any criminal acts related to the investigation."

It will mark the first time that lawmakers have compelled a former president to testify.\nStream San Diego News for free, 24/7, wherever you are with NBC 7.\nThe arrangement comes after months of negotiating between the two sides as Republicans sought to make the Clintons, both Democrats, a focal point in a House committee's investigation into Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in a New York jail cell in 2019, and Ghislaine Maxwell, his former girlfriend.\n“We look forward to now questioning the Clintons as part of our investigation into the horrific crimes of Epstein and Maxwell, to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people and for survivors,” Rep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, said in a statement.\nThe negotiation with the Clintons\nFor months, the Clintons resisted subpoenas from the committee, but House Republicans — with support from a few Democrats — had advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges to a potential vote this week. It threatened the Clintons with the potential for substantial fines and even prison time if they had been convicted.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that any effort to hold them in contempt of Congress were \"on pause.”\nEven as the Clintons bowed to the pressure, the negotiating between GOP lawmakers and attorneys for the Clintons was marked by distrust as they wrangled over the details of the deposition. They agreed to have the closed-door depositions transcribed and recorded on video, Comer said.\nThe belligerence is likely to only grow as Republicans relish the opportunity to grill longtime political foes under oath.\nComer told The Associated Press that Republicans, in their inquiry with the Clintons, were “trying to figure out how Jeffrey Epstein was able to surround himself with all these rich and powerful people.”\nComer, a Kentucky Republican, also said that the Clintons had expressed a desire to make the proceedings public, but that he would insist on closed-door testimony with a later release of a transcript of the interviews. He added that he was open to holding a later public hearing if the Clintons wanted it.\nHow Clinton knew Epstein\nClinton, like a number of other high-powered men including President Donald Trump, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Neither Trump nor Clinton has been credibly accused of wrongdoing in their interactions with the late financier.\nBoth Clintons have said they had no knowledge that Epstein was sexually abusing underage girls before prosecutors brought charges against him.\nThe Clintons had initially argued the subpoenas for their testimony were invalid and offered to submit sworn declarations on their limited knowledge of Epstein's crimes. But as Comer threatened to proceed with contempt of Congress charges, they began looking for an off-ramp.\nBoth Clintons have remained highly critical of how Comer has handled the Epstein investigation and argue that he is more focused on bringing them in for testimony rather than holding the Trump administration accountable for how it has handled the release of its files on Epstein.\nHowever, as Comer advanced the contempt charges out of the House Oversight Committee last month, he found a number of Democrats willing to help. A younger generation of more progressive Democrats showed they had few connections with the Clintons, who led the Democratic Party for decades, and were more eager to show voters that they would stand for transparency in the Epstein investigation.\nNine Democrats out of 21 on the Oversight panel voted to advance charges against Bill Clinton, and three Democrats joined with Republicans to support the charges against Hillary Clinton. As the vote loomed this week, House Democratic leaders also made it clear they would not expend much political capital to rally votes against the contempt resolutions.\nThat left the Clintons with little choice but to agree to testify or face one of the most severe punishments Congress can give.\nA precedent set?\nCongress has historically shown deference to former presidents. The Clintons' concession, however, prompted some Democrats to suggest that it set a precedent for former presidents to comply with congressional subpoenas.\n“We look forward to using this same precedent when we take back the majority in November,” Rep. Daniel Goldman, a New York Democrat, said on social media.\nTrump's attorneys successfully resisted a congressional subpoena in 2022, between his first and second terms, issued by a House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riot by a mob of his supporters at the U.S. Capitol. Trump’s lawyers cited decades of legal precedent they said shielded an ex-president from being ordered to appear before Congress, and the committee ultimately withdrew its subpoena.\nAt a signing for an unrelated bill later Tuesday, the president told reporters the depositions for the Clintons were “a shame” and said of Bill Clinton, “I always liked him.”\nHe also praised Hillary Clinton — his opponent in his first presidential election win in 2016 — for her debate skills and called her a “smart woman.”"

      "text": "Facing the hammer of contempt charges, Bill and Hillary Clinton have finally capitulated, agreeing to testify before the House Oversight Committee on their extensive ties to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\nWith Democrats joining the contempt vote, the Clintons had no choice but to comply, marking a pivotal moment in exposing the networks that protected predators among the powerful.\nThe saga began escalating in December 2025, when Chairman James Comer delivered a clear ultimatum to the Clintons.\nComer laid out the delays plainly: “It has been more than four months since Bill and Hillary Clinton were subpoenaed to sit for depositions related to our investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell’s horrific crimes. Throughout that time, the former President and former Secretary of State have delayed, obstructed, and largely ignored the Committee staff’s efforts to schedule their testimony.”\nA committee spokesperson reinforced the message: “We communicated to the Clintons’ attorney today that they must appear next week or provide a date in early January to appear for their depositions or we will begin contempt of Congress proceedings. They’ve been dragging their feet for over four months. Time’s up.”\nBy January 2026, the Clintons dug in their heels, outright refusing to appear and labeling the subpoenas invalid.\nTheir letter framed the resistance as a principled stand: “Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences… For us, now is that time.”\nThey went further, accusing Comer of engineering a witch hunt “literally designed to result in our imprisonment” and predicting he would “release irrelevant, decades-old photos that you hope will embarrass us.”\nThat bravado crumbled as the House advanced contempt recommendations, with even some Democrats voting yes. Now, the Clintons have signaled their agreement to appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates, while urging a pause on the contempt proceedings.\n? BREAKING — IT’S OFFICIAL: Bill and Hillary Clinton will be testifying in front of Congress regarding Jeffrey Epstein on February 26th and 27th\n— Nick Sortor (@nicksortor) February 3, 2026\n“Once it became clear that we would hold them in contempt, the Clintons completely caved and will appear for transcribed, filmed… pic.twitter.com/sghn3UxYKi\nComer had earlier rejected their push for lenient terms, like a voluntary interview in New York with custom transcription rules. He called out the entitlement: “Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency.”\nHighlighting the timeline of evasion, Comer noted: “It has been nearly six months since your clients first received the Committee’s subpoena, more than three months since the original date of their depositions, and nearly three weeks since they failed to appear for their depositions commensurate with the Committee’s lawful subpoenas.”\n?BREAKING?\n— Rep. James Comer (@RepJamesComer) February 3, 2026\nOnce it became clear that the House of Representatives would hold them in contempt, the Clintons completely CAVED and will appear for transcribed, filmed depositions this month.\nFormer President Clinton will appear for a deposition on February 27, 2026 and former…\nHe expressed doubt about relying on good faith alone: “But given that he has already failed to appear for a deposition and has refused for several months to provide the Committee with in-person testimony, the Committee cannot simply have faith that President Clinton will not refuse to answer questions at a transcribed interview, resulting in the Committee being right back where it is today.”\nResponding to the latest concession, Comer remained cautious: “The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions. The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt.”\nHe plans to verify the details: “I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”\nDetails on the format include Bill Clinton committing to a four-hour transcribed interview before the full committee—a setup he once deemed unfit for an ex-president.\nSuch an appearance is rare; no former president has testified before Congress since Gerald Ford in 1983.\nThe scrutiny stems from Bill Clinton’s documented entanglements, including over 20 flights on Epstein’s Lolita Express and 17 White House visits by the convicted sex trafficker.\nThis probe shifts focus to Democrat elites linked to Epstein, contrasting with past efforts that shielded them from fallout.\nAs the investigation presses on, it dismantles the notion that political royalty operates above the law.\nThis capitulation by the Clintons proves that relentless pursuit of truth can pierce even the thickest armor of establishment protection.\nYour support is crucial in helping us defeat mass censorship.

      "text": "After months of lawyerly jousting and slow-walking, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will sit for filmed, closed-door, transcribed depositions before the House Oversight Committee at the end of this month.\nChairman James Comer, R-Ky., says Hillary Clinton will appear Feb. 26, with Bill Clinton following Feb. 27, under the same terms. Both sessions will be recorded, Comer’s statement said.\nThis is the part of Washington where the calendar becomes a weapon. For weeks, the former first couple and the GOP-led committee haggled over whether they would testify, where, and on what conditions, as the committee pressed forward in its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and the government’s handling of his case.\nThen the cliff edge appeared.\nBoth Clintons were facing House contempt votes this week if they didn’t agree to in-person interviews. And those votes looked like they would pass.\nLate last month, nine Democrats on the Oversight Committee joined all Republicans in advancing Bill Clinton’s contempt resolution to a full House vote. Three Democrats voted to advance the contempt resolution against Hillary Clinton.\nA House contempt vote would refer them to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. A contempt of Congress conviction is a misdemeanor carrying a maximum $100,000 fine and up to a year in jail.\nComer framed the shift as capitulation under pressure.\n“Republicans and Democrats on the Oversight Committee have been clear: no one is above the law — and that includes the Clintons. After delaying and defying duly issued subpoenas for six months, the House Oversight Committee moved swiftly to initiate contempt of Congress proceedings in response to their non-compliance,” Comer said.\n“Once it became clear that the House of Representatives would hold them in contempt, the Clintons completely caved and will appear for transcribed, filmed depositions this month. We look forward to questioning the Clintons as part of our investigation into the horrific crimes of Epstein and Maxwell, to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people and for survivors.”\nThe Clintons are two of 10 people subpoenaed as part of the Oversight probe. So far, only two—former Attorney General Bill Barr and former Labor Secretary Alex Acosta—have appeared in person.\nThe Clintons’ attorneys have tried to draw a line around the committee’s power. In a letter last month, they called Comer’s subpoenas legally invalid, arguing they violate separation of powers and lack a valid legislative purpose.\n“President and Secretary Clinton have already provided the limited information they possess about Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to the Committee. They did so proactively and voluntarily, and despite the fact that the Subpoenas are invalid and legally unenforceable, untethered to a valid legislative purpose, unwarranted because they do not seek pertinent information, and an unprecedented infringement on the separation of powers,” the letter said.\nThe committee rejected those claims. Negotiations dragged. Comer twice rejected offers for himself and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the committee’s top Democrat, to travel to New York with limited staff to interview Bill Clinton.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, accused Comer of using contempt threats for politics rather than truth—arguing it was more about spectacle than closure for victims.\nBill Clinton’s past association with Epstein has long hovered over this story. He is among many high-profile names in files being released by the DOJ on the late sex offender. But the article notes there has been no implication of wrongdoing by either Clinton related to Epstein.\nStill, Washington doesn’t run on what’s proven. It runs on what’s pursued—and what can be made to look like a retreat.\nWith the contempt vote looming, the Clintons’ attorneys wrote to the committee Monday: “[M]y clients accept the terms of your letter and will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates. As has been the Committee’s practice, please confirm the House will not move forward with contempt proceedings, as the Chairman stated in his letter this morning.”\nIn this town, you don’t have to say “uncle.” You just have to show up."

James Comer (R-Ky.) said Tuesday on X.\nThough the Clintons portrayed themselves as victims of a partisan witch hunt, both the subpoena and the contempt push had significant support from Democrats.\nThe contempt resolutions would refer the Clintons to the Justice Department for prosecution. Defying a subpoena carries a penalty of up to a year in prison. Two former members of the first Trump administration served time for defying Democratic subpoenas during the Joe Biden administration.\nThe subpoena sparked a lengthy back-and-forth between the committee and lawyers for the Clintons, who complained they were being treated unfairly. They offered brief sworn statements about their relationships with Epstein and agreed to sit for untranscribed interviews in New York.\n“Despite everything that needs to be done to help our country, you are on the cusp of bringing Congress to a halt to pursue a rarely used process literally designed to result in our imprisonment,” the Clintons wrote in a statement last month.\nComer insisted the Clintons sit for normal depositions on Capitol Hill, and several Democrats agreed. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), a member of the Oversight Committee, noted Bill Clinton’s multiple trips aboard Epstein’s private plane and the many photographs of the two together. (In his sworn statement, Clinton said he accepted flights for philanthropic work because the plane could accommodate his staff and his Secret Service detail.)\n“With the number of flights he’s had, with a lot of the documents that have come up, he might have evidence that would be useful for the committee,” Lynch told HuffPost last month."

And it would be a distraction too, away from where the focus ought to be: on justice for the survivors the DOJ won’t talk to, and the perpetrators the DOJ won’t pursue.\nStill, how delicious would it be! As former president and former secretary of State, respectively, Bill and Hillary are in an excellent position to know some stuff about what US security services knew about Epstein. And now former presidents have been blessed with the power of declassifying and second-hand declassifying things with their minds!\nMaybe we could learn exactly what it was Bill Clinton found out in 2003 that made him drop Jeffrey Epstein like a hot potato and quit answering his calls. Was Bill tipped off by intelligence, or did he simply personally get creeped out by Epstein bringing around middle-school girls who kept trying to give him backrubs? Regardless, there is no dispute, Bill Clinton cut ties with Epstein years before Donald John Trump did, and sure as shit wasn’t his closest friend for 15 years.\nWhat might Hillary have learned about Epstein and friends during her tenure as secretary of State from 2009-’13? What does she know about Epstein’s friendships with people in Trump’s inner circle, like Steve Bannon and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick? Surely in 2015 if Hillary didn’t know about Lutnick’s friendship before she planned a fundraiser at his house next door to Epstein’s, the ensuing QAnon outrage clued her in.\nRussia, Russia, Russia!\nThe British press has been way more on top of the files than the American press, presumably more occupied by stomping out a thousand other flaming bags of dog doo at the same time, while still trying to maintain whatever crumbs of access to his Holy Office that Dear Leader will allow them.\nBut the Daily Mail goes there with an entire rundown of Epstein’s closeness to Putin, “Epstein’s sex empire was ‘KGB honeytrap’: Paedophile financier had multiple talks with Putin after conviction - with Russian girls flown in to harvest ‘kompromat’ on world-famous figures.” You must appreciate how they summarize stories in their titles so thoroughly!\nThe Mail is aggrieved in particular that “while US security services ‘monitored’ Epstein’s Russian connections for years, their UK equivalents were hesitant due to Epstein’s connection to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.” As well they should be! Only God and the ghost of the Queen know what kind of information or favors spies and foreign governments pumped out of randy, leaky Andy.\nThe Mail also notes that Ghislaine Maxwell potentially had her own foreign intelligence ties through her father Robert, who also happened to die under “murky circumstances”:\nSecurity sources say Robert Maxwell was a Russian asset from the 1970s, when he worked to extradite Soviet Jews to Israel, with the involvement of Israeli intelligence service Mossad.\nIn return, they say, Maxwell laundered Russian money into the West - with the help of Epstein.\nThey think the financier was introduced to Maxwell and the KGB by an oil tycoon also in the pay of Russian intelligence. Probes into Robert Maxwell’s business dealings have uncovered links not only to the KGB and Mossad - but also MI6.\nUS security officials also believe Epstein had long-standing ties with Russian organised crime, who could have been blackmailing him. That could explain the ease with which Epstein appeared to be able to fly in ‘girls’ from Russia.\nRussia blackmailing people with child prostitutes? It’s like the whole Steele Dossier story coming back full circle!\nSpeaking of full circle, Todd Blanche has come around to a little pedo cabal partying is fine. “It’s not a crime to party with Mr. Epstein. It’s not a crime to email Mr. Epstein.” Sounds like the GOP has found its bumper sticker for midterms!\nHairy with Bari\nCBS News’s top tone policer Bari Weiss is still refusing to fire Dr. Peter Attia, a longevity-wellness grifter and podcaster she’d hired last month to be a health contributor.\nAnd Weiss’s wife Nellie Bowles is in the files too, making Epstein’s acquaintance though someone named “Masha” (maybe Masha Drovka?) in 2018 while working as a reporter for the New York Times, following the beat of tech, bad-faith criticism of the Left, and sperm. Bowles’ sizzling scooptakes included “The Sperm Kings Have a Problem: Too Much Demand” and “Abolish the Police? Those Who Survived the Chaos in Seattle Aren’t So Sure,” and plenty of Silicon Valley/techbro tongue baths.\nAs for Attia, his name appears in more than 1,700 documents, some including some disgusting direct correspondence in the mid-2010s, as in long after Epstein’s Florida conviction.\nWhat a loser: In one email in 2016, titled “confirmed,” he wrote to Epstein: “Pussy is, indeed, low carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though.” Ladies, if your pussy has gluten, your yeast infection is so out of control it has started its own bakery.\nA couple of days earlier, Attia had also pitched his pricy personal longevity-themed medical consulting services to Epstein, asking, “Have you decided if you’re interested in living longer (solely for the ladies, of course)?”\nAnd in June 2015, Attia emailed Epstein with the subject line “got a fresh shipment,” Epstein replied, “me too,” with a photo that is redacted in the released document. Attia responded, “Please tell you found that picture on line…bastard,” to which Mr. Epstein said, “fraid not.”\nAttia responded, “the biggest problem with becoming friends with you? The life you lead is so outrageous, and yet I can’t tell a soul…”\nIn other places, Attia pathetically whinges to Epstein in a strange use of the third person that he goes “into JE withdrawal when I don’t see him” and suggests that he, Attia, wants to visit the island.\nAttia’s defense to the New York Times was that the shipment was the medication metformin, a diabetes treatment. That’s surely what he meant about the secret, outrageous life Epstein was living, Epstein’s secretly treated high blood sugar! Attia also claims Epstein’s photo was “of an adult woman,” and that he never actually visited sex island.\n“Reading that exchange now is very embarrassing, and I will not defend it,” Attia told the Times, while continuing to try to defend it some more as bad judgment from a young, naive man in his 40s.\nPoor Jeffrey Epstein, sounds like all of the men in his emails trying to find time to visit the island — Attia, Elon Musk, Howard Lutnick — ended up rudely standing him up, and any who showed up just happened to miss the sex parties and only arrived just in time for family picnic day instead!\nYeah, there’s no defense of it. But nice try, TODD.\nLast word to a disgusted survivor!\n[Wall Street Journal gift link / New York Times gift link]\nWonkette is ad-free and has NO PAYWALL, EVER, because how the hell are we supposed to fight disinformation when we won’t let people read us? If you are holding, and you are able, here is where you may make a one-time or recurring donation in any amount your heart desires. We love you!\nThis is the button for giving us any and all of your extra money with Venmo.\nThese dumb assholes talk like virgin 14 year old boys\n“Pussy is, indeed, low carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though.”\nSaid by someone who would only have their first not entirely consensual sexual encounter with a passed out theta when they were 20.\nDo they think this is a “gotcha” thing? Like they are going to “own the libs” if the Clintons are implicated in this mess?\nPut them in the same North Atlantic bound rowboat as everyone else in the files and throw them overboard if they so much as KNEW and did nothing, much less participated in the cabal of child rapists and blackmailers and money launderers.\nCan I get an amen?\nI knew I could.\nRepublicans really don’t understand moral convictions AT.

      "text": "Clintons Cave, Agree To Testify In House Epstein Investigation\nBill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee as part of the ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s vast network and influence. The former president and secretary of state dropped their opposition to congressional subpoenas just as lawmakers prepared to hold them in contempt for refusing to appear.\nAccording to a committee aide speaking to Politico, the Clintons made their decision ahead of a scheduled contempt vote in the House. While the exact date of their testimony has not been announced, their reversal clears a path for depositions that have been delayed since December.\nCommittee chair James Comer (R-KY) had previously granted a one-month postponement to allow the Clintons to attend a funeral. But after they failed to appear in January as rescheduled, the committee voted on a bipartisan basis to advance contempt proceedings to the full House floor.\nIn a letter released at the time, the Clintons claimed the subpoenas were “legally invalid” and accused the committee of engaging in “partisan politics.” They said they had already shared the limited information they possessed and questioned the motives behind the investigation. “For us, now is that time,” they wrote, signaling their readiness to take a stand despite the legal consequences.\nThough neither Clinton has been formally accused of wrongdoing related to Epstein, the former president has long faced scrutiny for his extensive ties to the convicted sex offender. Bill Clinton admitted to flying on Epstein’s private jet on four occasions and visiting his New York apartment once. But flight logs reviewed by the Washington Examiner revealed at least 27 flights involving Clinton, often without Secret Service detail.\nEpstein’s presence in the Clinton orbit dates back to the 1990s, when he visited the White House multiple times and attended a donor reception hosted by the Clintons in 1993 after making a $10,000 donation to the White House Historical Association.\nThe House Oversight Committee’s investigation aims to uncover how Epstein operated his sex trafficking network, how he cultivated influence in elite political circles, and what legislative gaps allowed him to evade scrutiny for so long. Chairman Comer has said the committee’s goal is to craft stronger laws to combat human trafficking and elite corruption.\nSince returning to office, President Trump has ordered the release of millions of pages of Epstein-related materials, including court filings, communications, videos, and financial records. The vast trove, dubbed the “Epstein files,” has already shed light on numerous high-profile individuals once shielded from public scrutiny.\nEpstein was found dead in his jail cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City in 2019 while awaiting trial. His death, ruled a suicide, has been the subject of widespread skepticism and fueled ongoing demands for transparency and justice. The Clintons’ upcoming testimony is expected to be a key moment in the House probe, which has already drawn attention across the political spectrum."

      "text": "Forcing Clintons To Testify About Epstein Won't Absolve Missing Witness Trump\nIf the House Oversight Committee’s Republican majority – or for that matter most of its Democratic members – felt a powerful motivation to uncover the truth about Jeffrey Epstein, there are many people with far more intimate knowledge of the pedophile financier and his crimes than Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nBut actual facts about this monumental scandal and real accountability for its perpetrators are of little concern to Rep. James Comer, the committee chairman who has singlemindedly abused his position to focus his \"investigation\" on the Clintons, or the House Republican leadership. Having failed to suppress the Epstein files as ordered by the White House, they have embarked on a renewed campaign of distraction and deflection.\nEven the servile Comer realizes that the most notorious potential witness is Donald J. Trump, whose name appears more than a thousand times, including very troubling allegations, in the files released by the Justice Department. With three million additional files yet to be examined, Trump’s name may appear many more times. Despite his false claim that the voluminous files somehow “exonerate” him, evidence in the public record proves that they had a long and intimate relationship during years when Epstein was abusing hundreds of underage girls – including at least one, the late Virginia Giuffre, who had worked at Mar-a-Lago.\nNow Comer would surely insist that the sitting president cannot be required to testify in the House of Representatives. But historically the same has been true of former presidents, a customary stricture that Comer breezily waved aside for an opportunity to harangue Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton – who never knew Epstein and can reveal nothing about him, but remains forever a tempting target for House Republicans with nothing better to do.\nFrom past observation of Comer's antics, we know he is uninterested in facts and treats his chairmanship as a perch from which to smear partisan opponents. So we can be confident that he won’t subpoena Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Elon Musk, or Steve Bannon, all of whom have plainly lied about their chummy relationships with Epstein. He isn’t going to take public testimony from the Republican lawyers -- most notably former Trump Labor Secretary Alex Acosta -- who arranged the sweetheart plea deal that allowed Epstein to continue his depredations. (One of those Epstein attorneys was Clinton nemesis Kenneth Starr, who alas is deceased.)\nThe purpose of Comer's phony inquest isn’t uncovering truth. If that is the objective of anyone else on the Oversight Committee, however, those worthies should educate themselves about the basic facts concerning Clinton and Epstein. To date, members of both parties – including the committee’s ranking member Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) – have displayed little knowledge about the witness they threatened with a contempt citation. To assist in their edification, let’s review:\nThere is no evidence that Bill Clinton knew anything about Epstein’s crimes before he was indicted. Like many other wealthy supporters of the Clinton Foundation, Epstein provided the use of his personal aircraft for charitable trips abroad, including a long 2002 trip to Africa for HIV/AIDS relief. Epstein and members of his entourage accompanied Clinton for parts of that trip, along with many other staff, including a young woman later identified as an Epstein victim. She posed for a photo with Clinton and described him as a “perfect gentleman.”\nThere is no evidence that Bill Clinton’s relationship with Epstein continued after the sex-trafficker became a target of federal law enforcement -- unlike many well-known and powerful individuals, such as Musk and Lutnick, whose names have turned up in the files. In fact, Clinton’s connection with him ended years before Epstein’s crimes became public.\nThere is no evidence that Bill Clinton ever visited Epstein’s Caribbean island, the site of many of his crimes, although Trump habitually repeats that particular lie. Among those who have dispelled that claim are Epstein himself, in a disclosed email, and White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, who said Trump’s accusations about Clinton were “wrong.” That observation was confirmed by former Attorney General William Barr, who oversaw the 2019 prosecution of Epstein, told the committee that “in the case of Bill Clinton, so far as I was aware, there was no evidence that he visited the island. You know, the government did not obtain any such evidence.”\nAnd Ghislaine Maxwell made the same declaration in her famous interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, at a moment when she was seeking clemency from Trump. Knowing that Trump and Blanche would want to hear the worst about Clinton, Maxwell nevertheless exonerated him fully.\n“He never, absolutely never went” to Little St. James Island,\" she said. \"And I can be sure of that because there's no way he would have gone. I don't believe there's any way that he would've gone to the island had I not been there. Because I don't believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein,” Maxwell continued, noting that Clinton had no interest or relationship with him except as “a rich guy with the plane” to be used for “humanitarian” trips to Africa and Asia. That is assuredly what she would tell Comer if he ever calls her to testify.\nAs for Hillary Clinton, there is no evidence whatsoever that the former first lady and secretary of state ever had anything to do with Epstein, or that she could reveal anything about him beyond what she has read in the newspapers. At a time when dozens of significant witnesses have escaped without a summons from Comer, the subpoena her issued to her is the ultimate proof that this “investigation” is merely the latest Congressional Republican misadventure.\nIt’s another episode of bad faith and deception. Nobody with a functioning brain should fall for it.\nJoe Conason is founder and editor-in-chief of The National Memo.

      "text": "Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee as part of its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, following congressional moves toward holding both in criminal contempt.\nThe committee said in a post on X that the ex-president and former Secretary of State were “trying to dodge contempt by requesting special treatment.”\n“The Clintons are not above the law,” the statement added.\nConfirmation of their appearance came from the Clintons’ spokesman, Angel Ureña.\nUreña posted on X that both Clintons would comply.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” Ureña wrote.\n“But the former president and former Secretary of State will be there and look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nThe House Oversight Committee is examining what the Clintons may have known about Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell.\nCommittee investigators are also scrutinizing Hillary Clinton’s role overseeing U.S. efforts to combat international sex trafficking during her tenure as Secretary of State.\nThe Clintons’ attorneys sent an email to the committee, confirming their agreement to testify under the terms outlined by Chairman James Comer (R-KY).\n“Please be advised, and please advise the Chairman, that my clients accept the terms of your letter and will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates,” the email states.\n“As has been the Committee’s practice, please confirm the House will not move forward with contempt proceedings, as the Chairman stated in his letter this morning.”\nHouse Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA) said the message constituted full compliance.\n“I mean, they sent us and the Republicans affirmation that they’ve accepted every single term that James Comer has asked for, and that they’re willing to come in and testify,” Garcia said.\nComer disputed that assessment, arguing the agreement lacked critical details.\nIn a statement, Comer said:\n“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again, and they have provided no dates for their depositions.\n“The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt.\n“I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”\nFollowing the Clintons’ reversal, House leaders temporarily paused contempt proceedings Monday night.\nThe House Rules Committee, which serves as the final gatekeeper before chamber-wide votes, had been preparing to advance contempt resolutions but abruptly shifted course.\nIt remains unclear whether or when the effort will resume.\nDemocrats on the committee have criticized Comer’s approach.\nThey argue that Comer has not threatened the Department of Justice (DOJ) for missing a congressionally agreed deadline to produce Epstein-related documents.\nThus far, the DOJ has yet to release all of the expected material.\nHowever, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche revealed that the delays are caused by the sheer volume of documents that need to be readacted to protect victims.\nBlanche said that, in total, the DOJ has released 6 million pages.\nHe said the size of the physical documents was equivalent to “two Eiffel towers.”\nOur comment section is restricted to members of the Slay News community only.\nTo join, create a free account HERE.\nIf you are already a member, log in HERE."

      "text": "Bill and Hillary Clinton agree to testify on Jeffrey Epstein investigation\nThe Clintons reversed course after House Oversight Committee voted to hold them in contempt over their refusal to comply with subpoenas\nA House Oversight and Government Reform Committee aide confirms that Bill and Hillary Clinton have consented to appear before the Committee as part of its probe into their ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The U.S. House Oversight Committee voted on January 21 of this year to find former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress, claiming they failed to respond to subpoenas connected to the Jeffrey Epstein probe.\nWhen subpoenaed to give testimony regarding their associations with Epstein, the Clintons declined to show up for depositions in January 2026, denouncing the Republican-controlled inquiry as \"legally invalid.\"\nThe refusal moved the Clintons nearer to a contempt of Congress vote. Should such a vote succeed, the charges could result in significant fines and potential imprisonment for both Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if convicted.\nRep. James Comer, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, announced on social media that he would demand both Clintons participate in sworn depositions before the committee to satisfy the panel's subpoenas. A correspondence from the committee to the Clintons' legal representatives reveals that the committee proposed a 4-hour recorded interview for Bill Clinton on \"matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein\" while Hillary Clinton would provide a sworn statement.\nThe Clintons have consistently refuted any criminal conduct and have never faced accusations of misconduct in relation to Jeffrey Epstein.\nNevertheless, Bill Clinton's ties to Epstein have emerged as a prominent Republican discussion point during efforts to pursue accountability concerning Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while detained at a New York facility awaiting sex trafficking charges.\nClinton, alongside many other prominent individuals, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s - once more, with no misconduct alleged.\nAfter the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas to both Clintons in August, their attorneys initially contested the subpoena's validity. However, as Comer threatened possible contempt-of-Congress measures, discussions toward a resolution commenced.\nThe Clintons leveled harsh criticism at Comer's tactics, alleging he was introducing partisan politics into the investigation while failing to hold the Trump administration accountable for delays in releasing the Department of Justice's Epstein case files. The prospect of such a vote creates an extraordinary situation: Congress potentially deploying one of its most severe sanctions against a former president.\nNever before has an ex-president been forced to testify before lawmakers, although some have voluntarily elected to appear.\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries announced Monday that his caucus would debate the contempt resolutions later this week, with his leadership team set to decide whether to rally votes in opposition."

      "text": "(The Center Square) – Former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have finally agreed to appear before the U.S. House Oversight Committee; however, a date has not been set.\nThe announcement came on the cusp of a vote to hold the couple in criminal contempt of Congress for failing to appear before the committee regarding the investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and their relationship to the disgraced financier.\nCommittee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., rejected an attempt from the Clintons’ attorneys to provide limited testimony, the former president to conduct a maximum four-hour transcribed interview, and the former first lady to submit a sworn declaration. Comer has dug in his heels, demanding that the couple appear before the committee.\nIn light of the latest development, the House Rules Committee has agreed to postpone proceeding with contempt of Congress charges – though it is not off the table with Comer noting to reporters that the committee doesn’t “have anything in writing” and is dependent on the terms.\n“Actions have consequences … Former President Clinton and former Secretary Clinton were legally required to appear for a deposition before the Oversight Committee,” Comer told the House Rules Committee.\nComer issued subpoenas to the Clintons in early August, noting examples of a potentially close relationship between the former president and Epstein in the letter to Bill Clinton.\n“By your own admission, you flew on Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane four separate times in 2002 and 2003. During one of these trips, you were even pictured receiving a ‘massage’ from one of Mr. Epstein’s victims,” the congressman wrote. “It has also been claimed that you pressured Vanity Fair not to publish sex trafficking allegations against your ‘good friend’ Mr. Epstein, and there are conflicting reports about whether you ever visited Mr. Epstein’s island. You were also allegedly close to Ms. Ghislane Maxwell, an Epstein co-conspirator, and attended an intimate dinner with her in 2014, three years after public reports about her involvement in Mr. Epstein’s abuse of minors.”\nComer’s letter to Hillary Clinton indicated that the former president’s trips on Epstein’s plane were part of the Clinton Family Foundation trips. He also included a connection between the former first couple and Maxwell, noting that Maxwell’s nephew was employed by Hillary Clinton’s 2008 failed presidential campaign and then hired by the State Department after becoming Secretary of State.\nComer insists the purpose of the investigation is to “inform legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.”\nThanks to modern technologies, you and more people are reading the Watauga Democrat than ever before.

Straight Facts™.\nPoint phone camera here\nClintons agree to testify in Epstein probe\nIn a turn of events in Congress’s investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, say they have agreed to testify before Congress about their past interactions with Epstein.\nThe decision comes as House Oversight Chair James Comer was pushing to hold both Clintons in contempt of Congress for their prior refusal to testify.\nA House vote on contempt resolutions had been expected as early as Wednesday.\nA spokesperson for Bill Clinton said in a post on X the Clintons have “negotiated in good faith,” adding they have already “told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care,” and they will now appear before the committee.\nFollowing the announcement, Comer said he is reconsidering whether to move the contempt resolutions forward, but stressed that no final agreement is in place.\nIn a statement, Comer said the Clintons’ attorneys claim they’ve agreed to terms, but those terms remain unclear, and no dates have been set for depositions.\nComer added that the agreement came only after the House advanced contempt proceedings, saying he plans to clarify the terms with the Clintons’ legal team before deciding on next steps with committee members.\nShutdown vote set for Tuesday as DHS funding drives final showdown\nNow to the partial government shutdown, with all eyes on the House and a high-stakes vote expected Tuesday.\nPresident Donald Trump says he’s working closely with Speaker Mike Johnson to pass a funding bill without changes.\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said the two are committed to “work together in good faith to address the issues that have been raised.”\nThe main sticking point remains funding for Homeland Security following two ICE-related killings in Minneapolis, and growing criticism over aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.\nOn Monday, the House Rules Committee advanced the package.\nThe plan funds five or six outstanding bills, covering the departments of defense, treasury, and state, while granting a two-week extension for dhs.\n“This package is the result of negotiations with the president and Senators. But ultimately, it’s five of the six bills that we have already passed through the house,” said House Majority Leader. Steve Salise, R-La. “Homeland is just gonna go under a cr. We would have liked the whole package to go to the president’s desk.”\nTrump has already struck a deal with Senate leaders, who approved temporary funding for DHS through Feb. 13, buying lawmakers time to debate possible new limits on immigration and customs enforcement.\nMeanwhile, the House’s GOP margin just got tighter.\n.@SpeakerJohnson swears in Rep. Christian Menefee (D-TX) into the House of Representatives.\n— CSPAN (@cspan) February 3, 2026\nThe whole number of the House is now 432:\n218 Republicans\n214 Democrats\n3 vacancies pic.twitter.com/qH0rkkJJ2P\nDemocrats now hold 214 seats after Christian Menefee was sworn in Monday night after winning a special election in Texas on Saturday.\nThat shrinks the Republican majority to 218-214, leaving Speaker Johnson with little room for error.\nDHS orders body cameras for all immigration agents in Minneapolis\nThere’s a notable shift in immigration enforcement—one that could shape the next phase of this fight.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says all federal immigration officers in Minneapolis will now wear body cameras, effective immediately.\nNoem announced the move on social media, saying she ordered the deployment after speaking with ICE, Customs and Border Protection and White House Border Czar Tom Homan. She says the program will expand nationwide as funding becomes available.\nThe decision follows intense scrutiny over two deadly shootings by federal agents in the Twin Cities, including the killing of Alex Petti last month and an earlier shooting that killed Renee Good. Both cases sparked protests and raised questions about transparency tactics.\nTrump backed the move Monday, saying body cameras are generally good for law enforcement because they make it harder to dispute what happened.\nDHS has already sent thousands of agents into the Minneapolis area as part of a broader crackdown, and while some agents were already using body cameras in limited cases, the department has faced bipartisan pressure to make them mandatory.\nSearch in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s mother shifts to criminal investigation\nAuthorities in Arizona now consider the disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s mother a crime after what they found inside her home raised serious concerns. That includes a possible kidnapping or abduction.\nNancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen late Saturday night at her home outside Tucson. Her family reported her missing around noon on Sunday after she failed to show up for church, triggering an intensive search.\nBy Monday, the Pima County Sheriff’s Office said the focus had shifted.\n“We believe now that after processing that crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime scene, that we do in fact have a crime. And we’re asking the community’s help,” Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said.\nNanos would not describe what investigators found, but said it was enough to bring in homicide detectives and to pause search-and-rescue operations. The sheriff emphasized that this was not a dementia-related case, saying Nancy Guthrie is of sound mind, but has limited mobility and could not have left on her own.\n“This is an 84-year-old lady who suffers from some physical ailments, has some physical challenges, and is in need of medication. Medication that if she doesn’t have in 24 hours, it could be fatal,” Nanos said.\nInvestigators said Nancy Guthrie cannot walk more than short distances without assistance and needs daily medication to survive.\nAuthorities said there is no known threat to the public, but they are urging neighbors to review security and doorbell camera footage.\n“It’s very bizarre. This is a very safe neighborhood,” Lisa McIntire, a neighbor of Guthrie, told a reporter. “The first thing that comes to my mind is that this probably is not going to be a good outcome.”\nSavannah Guthrie was absent from this morning’s broadcast again, but she posted a message on her Instagram page late Monday night.\nIn it, she said:\n“We believe in prayer. We believe in voices raised in unison, in love, in hope. We believe in goodness. We believe in humanity. Above all, we believe in Him.\nThank you for lifting your prayers with ours for our beloved mom, our dearest Nancy, a woman of deep conviction, a good and faithful servant. Raise your prayers with us and believe with us that she will be lifted by them in this very moment.\nWe need you.\n‘He will keep in perfect peace those whose hearts are steadfast, trusting in the Lord.’ A verse of Isaiah for all time for all of us.\nBring her home.”\nTrump pushes to ‘nationalize’ voting, links noncitizens to widespread fraud\nTrump is urging Republicans to “take over” voting nationwide, repeating unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud as his administration pushes to reshape election rules ahead of this year’s midterms.\nThe comments come as the White House and congressional Republicans move to overhaul election procedures. It’s a push that has already drawn sharp criticism from voting-rights advocates and election officials.\nIn an interview with conservative podcaster Dan Bongino, who resigned as deputy FBI director in December, Trump alleged that noncitizen voting is influencing election outcomes — a claim that election officials and multiple investigations have rejected.\nDonald Trump went on Dan Bongino’s show and said Republicans should nationalize elections across the country so they can take it over. We need to take him very seriously when he says things like this. pic.twitter.com/RndIq47CCZ\n— Mike Nellis (@MikeNellis) February 2, 2026\n“The Republicans should say, ‘We want to take over. We should take over the voting in at least many, 15 places.’ The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting. We have states that are so crooked, and they’re counting votes,” Trump said.\nTrump’s remarks come less than a week after the FBI searched an elections office in Fulton County, Georgia, a jurisdiction that has long been at the center of his false claims about the 2020 election.\nArtemis II launch delayed, March now earliest launch window\nNASA has delayed its Artemis II mission after a problem during a critical overnight test. Mission managers say engineers detected a hydrogen leak at the base of the space launch system rocket during a full wet dress rehearsal, a countdown test simulating launch conditions.\nThe space agency called off the test just after midnight, with about five minutes left in the simulated countdown. As a result, the agency is now scrapping February’s launch window entirely and says March is the earliest possible launch opportunity.\nNASA completed a wet dress rehearsal for the Artemis II mission in the early morning hours on Feb. 3. To allow teams to review data and conduct a second wet dress rehearsal, NASA will now target March as the the earliest possible launch opportunity for the Artemis II mission.… pic.twitter.com/jSnCUPLQb6\n— NASA (@NASA) February 3, 2026\nNASA says potential launch dates now run from March 6 through March 9, with another window on March 11. If those are not successful, additional opportunities will be available in April if needed.\nThe mission would send four astronauts on a crewed flight around the Moon, a major step toward future lunar landings.\nMore from Straight Arrow News:\nTrump’s threat to sue Noah over a joke would face a tough crowd in court\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened to sue comedian Trevor Noah over jokes Noah made while hosting the Grammys. During the broadcast, Noah made a quip about Trump being in the Epstein files.\nNoah’s joke came after the award for Song of the Year went to Billie Eilish.\n“That is a Grammy that every artist wants almost as much as Trump wants Greenland, which makes sense, I mean, because Epstein’s Island is gone, he needs a new one to hang out on with Bill Clinton,” Noah joked.

The decision follows months of resistance, during which the former president and former secretary of state declined to comply with committee subpoenas and risked being held in contempt of Congress.\nThe shift came as the House prepared to vote this week on contempt resolutions that could have carried legal consequences. According to Politico, GOP leaders have not ruled out moving forward with those votes if they determine the Clintons are not acting in good faith or fail to promptly schedule depositions with committee members and staff.\nAfter previously arguing that the subpoenas lacked a legitimate legislative purpose, the Clintons announced their willingness to comply as the House Rules Committee met to advance the contempt measures. The move disrupted Republican leadership plans and left uncertainty about how the process will proceed.\nA spokesperson for Bill Clinton said the former first couple “look forward[s] to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.” Both Clintons have stated they had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes and have maintained that the investigation was politically motivated and designed to embarrass them.\nHouse Oversight Chair James Comer expressed skepticism about the timing of their decision. “The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions,” Comer said. “The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt.”"

      "text": "WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee over an investigation into late financier Jeffrey Epstein, a spokesperson announced Monday.\n\"The former President and former Secretary of State will be there,\" said Angel Urena, a spokesperson for Bill Clinton, in response to a post by the committee on the social platform X. \"They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"\nThe committee, in its post, accused the Clintons of \"defying lawful subpoenas\" and \"trying to dodge contempt by requesting special treatment.\"\nAccording to a New York Times report, in an email sent Monday evening to committee chair James Comer, attorneys for the Clintons said their clients would \"appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates,\" urging the House not to proceed with a contempt vote scheduled for Wednesday.\nThe report said the development signaled that the Clintons were \"capitulating to the demands of its Republican chairman\" just days before the House was expected to vote on holding them in criminal contempt of Congress.\nIn a public letter to Comer dated Jan. 13, the Clintons said they would not comply with a congressional subpoena requiring their testimony, calling it \"legally invalid.\" They also said they had already provided the committee with all information in their possession related to the Epstein case.\nOn Jan. 21, the committee voted to advance a motion to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress and referred it to the full House for a vote.\nEpstein maintained close ties with numerous prominent figures in U.S. political and business circles. He died in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.\nOn Dec. 19, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) began publishing documents related to Epstein on its website. The initial batch included multiple references to the former Democratic president, prompting accusations that the DOJ was selectively releasing materials.\nSome U.S. media outlets interpreted the move as an effort to shield prominent figures associated with President Donald Trump's Republican camp. ■"

      "text": "Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016, said overnight Monday into Tuesday that they will agree to testify before Congress about their ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after months of confrontation with Republicans who control the House of Representatives.\nThe decision came just before the House was set to vote on holding the Clintons in contempt of Congress, an unprecedented step against a former president that would have opened the door to possible criminal charges against the couple.\nThe Clintons were subpoenaed last August to appear before the House Oversight Committee as part of a Republican-led investigation into the Epstein case. For months, they refused to comply, arguing the effort was a political maneuver aimed at shielding Republican President Donald Trump, who, like Bill Clinton, had also been acquainted with Epstein.\nThe couple said they were willing to testify under their own conditions. They proposed that Bill Clinton testify under oath at his New York office and that Hillary Clinton submit a written statement. Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, a Republican, rejected those proposals and demanded that both appear in person before his committee.\nAfter the Clintons refused to comply with the subpoena, the Oversight Committee last month recommended that the full House hold them in contempt of Congress. The move was seen as a setback for the couple, particularly because several Democratic members of the committee joined Republicans in supporting the recommendation.\nThat committee vote paved the way for a final vote in the full House. Republicans hold a narrow majority, 218 to 214, but only a simple majority would be required, and some Democrats had already backed the measure. Beyond the historical stigma — no former U.S. president has ever been convicted of contempt of Congress — approval would have allowed the Justice Department, led by officials appointed by Trump, to pursue criminal proceedings against Bill and Hillary Clinton. Contempt of Congress carries a potential penalty of up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine. Trump ally Steve Bannon previously served four months in prison after being convicted of contempt of Congress for refusing to appear before the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nLate Monday, just before the House Rules Committee was set to advance the measure toward a floor vote, a spokesman for the Clintons announced they would appear before the Oversight Committee.\nA spokesman for the Clintons said they had already provided sworn accounts of what they know, but that the committee had disregarded them. He said the former president and former secretary of state would now appear in person and that they expect a standard to be set that applies equally to all, a reference to the fact that no U.S. president has ever been compelled to testify before Congress. The statement also implied that Trump should face the same requirement. Following the announcement, the procedural vote scheduled in the Rules Committee was postponed.\nComer said he was not yet prepared to drop the threat of a contempt vote, noting that the final terms of the testimony had not been agreed upon. “We don’t have anything in writing,” he told reporters at the Capitol, adding that he was open to the Clintons’ proposal but that it “depends on what they say.”\nBill Clinton, like many prominent figures and celebrities, maintained a social relationship with financier Jeffrey Epstein from the late 1990s through the early 2000s. Clinton has said he was unaware of Epstein’s sexual crimes against underage girls and has expressed regret over the association.\nLast month, as part of the release of investigative files in the case, several embarrassing photographs of Clinton surfaced, including images showing him naked in a jacuzzi alongside a person whose face was obscured. The images do not establish his involvement in the sexual abuse of minors, and there is no known allegation against him in the Epstein case."

As messages emerge from Sarah Ferguson congratulating him on the birth of a son, Katie Rosseinsky examines what we know about the woman who stood to inherit a fortune\nOwen Scott3 February 2026 12:00\nFury continues to build as activists say that more Epstein files are being withheld\nAnger over the botched handling of the release of the Epstein files by the DOJ continues to build, as over 3 million documents remain undisclosed.\nThe Epstein Files Transparency Act required all documents to be released by December 19.\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche says that his department has delivered on realising the files, albeit a month late.\n“After submitting the final report to Congress as required under the act and publishing the written justifications for redactions in the Federal Register, the department’s obligations under the act will be completed,” Blanche told reporters.\nHowever, lawyers defending Epstein’s victims say this is not good enough.\nJennifer Plotkin, of Merson Law, which represents more than 30 victims, says that the Trump administration is failing victims.\n“The government continues to avoid accountability and has argued that they are not responsible for Epstein’s abuse of hundreds of victims,” she told The Guardian. “The release of the files proves the government failed the victims over and over again.”\nDr Ann Olivarius, a women’s rights attorney, also questioned why only files related to Epstein’s crimes have been released and not documents naming those who aided and abetted him.\n“We have plenty of files on Epstein’s depravity. What we are missing are the files on his immunity,” she told The Guardian. “The question isn’t just ‘who was on [Epstein’s] plane?’ but ‘who made the phone call that stopped the 2007 investigation?’\n“A disclosure is not complete if it tells us something about the criminal but nothing about the shield.”\nShe also said that she is “suspicious” of the current investigation and believes “tactical misuse” may have been applied to some of the documents.\nOwen Scott3 February 2026 11:36\nTrump's Washington construction projects could be a sign that he's worried about the Epstein files\nSome presidents get statues. Some get libraries. Donald Trump, reportedly eyeing the construction of a now 250-foot arch to himself in the middle of Washington, DC, is very keen this week to seal his legacy in a different kind of way.\nBut it does seem a little badly timed, considering the whole “big tranche of documents about the pedophile island for billionaires” thing, doesn’t it?\nIf you look at it another way — and there will be a lot of ways to look at it, if it’s really built that big — the whole thing is more about anxiety than ego.\nEverybody is dealing with these revelations in different ways, writes Holly Baxter, and Trump’s coping mechanism has always been building massive, gaudy structures covered in gold\nOwen Scott3 February 2026 11:24\nWatch: Epstein victims hold up photographs from when they were abused\nIn a moving video, the victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s child sex trafficking ring opened up about overcoming abuse by the convicted pedophile.\nMany of the victims held up photographs of themselves at the age at which they were abused.\n“This is me when I met Jeffrey Epstein,” one says.\n“There are about a thousand of us,” another adds.\n“It’s time to bring the secrets out of the shadows,” a third victim says.\nOwen Scott3 February 2026 10:39\nEpstein tried to court Vladimir Putin, according to new releases\nSpeaking to Laura Ingraham on her eponymous show The Ingraham Angle, Blanche suggested that some evidence in the Epstein files may not be enough to lead to prosecutions.\n“But, as you know, it is not a crime to party with Mr Epstein,” Blanche told Ingraham. “And so, as horrible as it is, it’s not a crime to email with Mr Epstein.\n“And some of these men may have done horrible things. And, if we have evidence that allows us to prosecute them, you better believe we will.\n“But it’s also the kind of thing that the American people need to understand that it isn’t a crime to party with Mr Epstein. It isn’t a crime to have lunch on his island.”\nWhen Ingraham asked whether some of the photos suggest more wrongdoing than simply lunching or partying with Epstein, Blanche was evasive.\n“Unfortunately, photos can't speak,” he said. “And so we need witnesses and we need evidence,” before stating all videos from the files have been released.\nHe did caveat that claim, though.\n“Not of any individuals, men having improper sex or anything with victims,” he said. “But there's videos.

      "text": "\"Wonderful thing, subpoenas,\" Wilford Brimley wryly observed in the 1981 film Absence of Malice. Perhaps criminal referrals for contempt of Congress are even more wonderful. Especially with a Department of Justice champing at the bit to prosecute them in the Epstein Files case, when it comes to Bill and Hillary Clinton.\nOne day before the full House vote to approve those referrals, the Clintons have caved, at least according to the Associated Press. House Oversight chair James Comer has not yet confirmed compliance, and Comer suspects that the two may try a couple of more manipulations before fully surrendering:\nFormer President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed late Monday to testify in a House investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the Republican leading the probe said an agreement had not yet been finalized.\nRep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, continued to press for criminal contempt of Congress charges against both Clintons Monday evening for defying a congressional subpoena when attorneys for the Clintons emailed staff for the Oversight panel, saying the pair would accept Comer’s demands and “will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.”\nThe attorneys requested that Comer, a Kentucky Republican, agree not to move forward with the contempt proceedings. Comer, however, said he was not immediately dropping the charges, which would carry the threat of a substantial fine and even incarceration if passed by the House and successfully prosecuted by the Department of Justice.\nHow did the Clintons end up in this predicament? The Democrats seized the Epstein Files Monkey's Paw to use as a weapon against Donald Trump, only to discover Bill Clinton in a hot tub with an unidentified young female at Jeffrey Epstein's residence. The Tubba Bubba pics forced Democrats to choose whether to stonewall for the Clintons and drop the Epstein Files Monkey's Paw, or to grimly hold onto their Orange Man Bad dream and throw the Clintons under the bus.\nTwo weeks ago, enough House Democrats chose the latter to make the passage of the contempt charge and criminal referral look bipartisan in nature. Presumably, Bill and Hillary have tried to rally support for enough votes to force Mike Johnson to pass the referral on a party-line basis only, with just a two-seat margin of error. With the vote coming tomorrow, it looks as though the Clintons have belatedly discovered that they have become expendable in the Great Orange Man Quest ... and reasonably so, under the circumstances, since the Clintons still haven't explained what Bill was doing in the hot tub.\nThey waited until the last minute, though. The bill for the referral is about to come out of the Rules committee, but now is being held up until the Clintons make a firm commitment to appear as ordered by their subpoenas. They're still trying to haggle over the terms:\nComer earlier Monday rejected an offer from attorneys for the Clintons to have Bill Clinton conduct a transcribed interview and Hillary Clinton submit a sworn declaration. He insisted that both Clintons sit for sworn depositions before the committee in order to fulfill the panel’s subpoenas.\nA letter from the committee to attorneys for the Clintons indicated that they had offered for Bill Clinton to conduct a 4-hour transcribed interview on “matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein” and for Hillary Clinton to submit a sworn declaration.\nThat's why Comer is maintaining his skepticism until the Clintons actually appear. He's been here before with the Clintons:\nIt is unclear when the depositions might be held; as of Monday evening, Oversight staff members were still negotiating with the Clintons’ attorneys on the perimeters [sic] of the sessions. [Note to the WaPo editors – parameters, not perimeters. -- Ed]\n“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions,” Comer said in a statement. “The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt. I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”\nThat's a wise decision, but let's not kid ourselves. The Clintons know exactly what they face, because the Biden Regency set the precedent of prosecuting refusals to appear while under a congressional subpoena:\nContempt of Congress — which is punishable by up to a year in prison — is rarely invoked, but it has been utilized more in recent years. Lawmakers found Stephen K. Bannon and Peter Navarro in contempt of Congress in 2021 for defying a subpoena issued by the special committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Both served four-month sentences.\nThe days of only one side playing by Marquess de Queensbury rules are over. And the Clintons know it. They'll show, and they'll show under Comer's terms, not theirs. Whether they actually testify is another matter, but the spectacle of the Clintons taking the Fifth will be ... clarifying, at least.\nEditor’s Note: The mainstream media isn't interested in the facts; they're only interested in attacking the president.

      "text": "The Clintons have agreed to testify in the House Oversight Committee’s inquiry into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after months of asserting that they have been targeted as part of a politically motivated effort to shift attention away from President Donald Trump’s ties to Epstein and the Justice Department’s controversial handling of documents related to the investigation.\nRead More: How the Latest Release of Epstein Files Was Felt Around the World\nLawyers for former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a Monday evening email to the committee’s chairman Rep. James Comer (R, Ky.) that their clients agreed to “appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.” The submission, which was first reported by the New York Times, came just before a scheduled House vote to hold them in criminal contempt of Congress, which was slated for Wednesday.\nThe Clintons had been seeking to negotiate terms with Comer to avoid a contempt vote, including to introduce constraints to the duration and scope of questioning, but ultimately agreed to comply with all of Comer’s demands.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not. They told you under oath what they know, but you did not care,” Angel Ureña, a spokesperson for Bill Clinton, said on social media. “But the former president and former secretary of state will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\n“As has been the committee’s practice, please confirm the House will not move forward with contempt proceedings, as the chairman stated in his letter this morning,” the Clintons’ attorneys said in the letter to Comer.\nRep. Robert Garcia (D, Calif.), the top Democrat on the committee, told reporters that there isn’t “any scenario” in which Comer can reject their agreement and move forward with the vote.\n“If you try to move forward” on a contempt vote,” Garcia said, “it would be clearly a demonstration that Comer is actually not interested in hearing the Clintons, but he’s only interested in political games. I think that would be a huge disservice to the survivors and to the investigation.”\nBut Comer’s office told news outlets that the Clintons “provided no dates for their depositions,” and that Comer plans to clarify the terms of the agreement before discussing “next steps” with committee members. It is not yet clear whether the contempt vote will move forward.\nThe last time that a former President testified before a congressional panel was when Gerald Ford appeared to discuss a commemorative project for the bicentennial of the Constitution in 1983. Trump was subpoenaed in 2022 to testify in the congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, but the panel eventually withdrew the subpoena after he sued to block it.\nClintons say political persecution\nThe committee voted to subpoena the Clintons last August as part of its investigation into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison. Clinton has appeared in photos with Epstein in documents slowly released by the DOJ, and previously released flight logs show that Bill Clinton took four international trips on board Epstein’s private jet in 2002 and 2003, accompanied by staff and Secret Service agents, although it’s not clear how many individual flights were part of each trip.\nThe Clintons for months refused to comply with the subpoenas, arguing that they were legally invalid and were an attempt to target Trump’s political adversaries.\nAmid scrutiny of Trump by both Democrats and some of his MAGA base over his appearances in the Epstein files, the President has sought to focus attention on associations between Epstein and prominent Democrats. Bill Clinton has said that he had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, never visited his private island, and ended his association with him 20 years ago, long before the disgraced financier’s death in 2019. Hillary Clinton has said that she “has no personal knowledge of Epstein or Maxwell's criminal activities, never flew on his aircraft, never visited his island, and cannot recall ever speaking to Epstein.”\n“Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences,” the Clintons wrote in a Jan. 13 letter to Comer. “For us, now is that time.”\nIn the letter, the Clintons accused Comer of unfairly targeting them by pursuing a “rarely used process literally designed to result in our imprisonment.”\n“You subpoenaed eight people in addition to us. You dismissed seven of those eight without any of them saying a single word to you. You made no attempt to force them to appear. In fact, since you started your investigation last year, you have interviewed a total of two people,” they wrote. “You claim your subpoenas are inviolate when they are used against us yet were silent when the sitting President took the same position, as a former president, barely more than three years ago.”\nThe Clintons have repeatedly called for the Justice Department to release all of its Epstein files, as it was required to do by law by Dec. 19, including any materials that may contain references to them.\nBut last month, nine Democrats on the Oversight Committee joined Republicans in January to recommend charging Bill Clinton with criminal contempt and three Democrats joined to do the same for Hillary Clinton. Criminal contempt of Congress is a mechanism that the House or Senate can use to penalize a person for wilfully refusing to comply with a lawful or congressional subpoena. The vote itself does not impose penalties, but it would be the first step in formally referring them to the DOJ, which can then decide whether to pursue prosecution. If then convicted, a sentence would typically involve fines and/or up to a year in jail.\nMost criminal contempt referrals to the DOJ have not resulted in prosecutions; of seven referrals from the House between 2019 and 2024, only two led to indictments. Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist during Trump’s first term, was indicted on two misdemeanor counts and convicted in July 2022 for refusing to comply with a subpoena investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. His conviction was upheld by a federal appeals court in May 2024 and he served four months in prison before being released in October. Trump’s chief trade adviser Peter Navarro was also indicted on two counts in June 2022 for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee. He was convicted by a jury in September 2023 and sentenced to four months in prison. He was released in July 2024 after completing his sentence.\nThe Clintons had still sought to negotiate with the committee in order to avoid a contempt vote, including offering for Comer and Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel, to interview Bill Clinton under oath. After Comer refused and said the Clintons must appear before the whole committee for a transcribed interview, the Clintons on Saturday tried to negotiate for a four-hour transcribed interview with the committee limited to questions related to Epstein for Bill Clinton and a sworn declaration instead of a testimony for Hillary Clinton, according to the Times.\nComer rejected the Clintons’ offers, calling Bill Clinton a “loquacious individual” and that four hours would therefore be insufficient for questioning. “Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency,” Comer wrote in a letter on Monday that was posted on social media.\nOn Monday evening, the Clintons relented, agreeing to comply with Comer’s demands.\nSome Democrats have criticized the committee’s pursuit of the Clintons as an attempt to distract voters from Trump’s ties to Epstein and other concerns ahead of the 2026 midterms, especially in involving Hillary Clinton, who has been vilified by Trump and his allies since she ran against him in the 2016 presidential election.\n“I’m not seeing anything to suggest she ought to be a part of this in any way,” Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D, Md.), a member of the Oversight Committee, said at a hearing in January. He added that it seemed the committee had included her because “we want to dust her up a bit.”\nRecalling Trump’s 2016 chants against Hillary Clinton to “lock her up,” Philippe Reines, an adviser to the Clintons, told the Times that the Democrats who joined Republicans last month in voting to recommend the House hold the Clintons in contempt, “stand with MAGA in chanting ‘lock them up.’”"

Kelly sued the Pentagon last month over retaliation for his participation in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders. Hegseth later censured Kelly, a move that could result in a demotion from his retired rank of captain and a reduction in retirement pay.

      "text": "Clintons agree to testify in House Epstein investigation\nWASHINGTON >> Bill and Hillary Clinton agreed on Monday to testify in the House Oversight Committee’s investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, capitulating to the demands of its Republican chair days before the House was expected to vote to hold them in criminal contempt of Congress.\nFor months, the Clintons had been adamant that they would not comply with subpoenas from Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, the panel’s Republican chair, that they have described as invalid and legally unenforceable. They accused Comer of being part of a plot to target them as President Donald Trump’s political adversaries and promised to fight him on the issue for as long as it took.\nBut after some Democrats on the panel joined Republicans in a vote to recommend charging them with criminal contempt, an extraordinary first step in referring them to the Justice Department for prosecution, the Clintons ultimately waved the white flag and agreed to fully comply with Comer’s demands.\nIn an email sent to Comer on Monday evening, attorneys for the Clintons said their clients would “appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates” and asked that the House not move forward with a contempt vote, which had been slated for Wednesday.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” spokespersons for the Clintons said in a statement. “They told under oath what they know, but you did not care. But the former president and former secretary of state will be there.”\nFor Bill Clinton to testify in the Epstein investigation would be nearly unprecedented. No former president has appeared before Congress since 1983, when former President Gerald Ford did so to discuss the celebration of the 1987 bicentennial of the enactment of the Constitution. When Trump was subpoenaed in 2022 by the select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, after he had left office, he sued the panel to try to block it. The panel ultimately withdrew the subpoena.\nDon't miss out on what's happening!\nStay in touch with breaking news, as it happens, conveniently in your email inbox. It's FREE!\nThe Clintons’ move capped a monthslong battle between them and Comer. It was a victory for the Republican chair’s efforts to shift the focus of his panel’s Epstein investigation away from Trump’s ties to Epstein and his administration’s handling of the matter and onto prominent Democrats who once associated with the disgraced financier and his longtime companion, Ghislaine Maxwell.\nIn a letter Saturday to Comer, which was obtained by The New York Times, Bill Clinton’s lawyers tried one more time to put some guardrails on potential interviews with the Clintons. They said Bill Clinton would agree to sit for a four-hour transcribed interview with the entire committee — something he had previously described as an inappropriate and unprecedented request to make of a former president.\nThe lawyers asked that Hillary Clinton, who has said she never met or spoke to Epstein, be allowed to make a sworn declaration instead of testifying. But they said that she, too, would submit to an in-person interview if the committee insisted on it, “with appropriate adjustments for the paucity of information she has to offer in this matter,” according to the letter.\nBut Comer flatly rejected the offer, calling it “unreasonable” and arguing that four hours of testimony from Bill Clinton was inadequate given that he was a “loquacious individual” who might seek to run out the clock.\n“Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency,” Comer wrote in a letter sent to the Clintons’ lawyers on Monday that was also obtained by the Times.\nIn that letter, Comer also rejected the demand from Bill Clinton that the scope of the interview be limited to matters related to Epstein. Comer said the former president “likely has an artificially narrow definition in mind” of what matters would be related to the Epstein investigation.\nComer said he had concerns that Clinton would refuse to answer questions about “his personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, ways in which they sought to curry favor with powerful individuals and alleged efforts to utilize his power and influence after his presidency to kill negative news stories about Jeffrey Epstein.”\nIn response to Comer’s letter, the Clintons on Monday evening agreed to all of Comer’s demands, removing any time limit on the deposition of Bill Clinton or on the range of topics that Republicans could ask him about.\nThe only point of negotiation that Comer had previously been amenable to was conducting the interviews in New York, where the Clintons live and work.\nClinton was acquainted with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, but has said he never visited Epstein’s private island and cut off contact with him two decades ago. Clinton took four international trips on Epstein’s private jet in 2002 and 2003, according to flight logs.\nWhile some House Democrats last month voted with Republicans to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress, others expressed disgust at the entire situation, and in particular about the inclusion of Hillary Clinton.\n“I’m not seeing anything to suggest she ought to be a part of this in any way,” Rep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., said at a hearing last month, noting that it looked like the former secretary of state had been included because “we want to dust her up a bit if we get her before this committee.”\nThe offer from the Clintons represented a total surrender after they made a defiant stand just weeks ago, vowing to fight back against an investigation they said was unfairly targeting them and holding them to a different standard from others.\n“Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences,” the Clintons wrote in a lengthy letter to Comer on Jan. 13. “For us, now is that time.”\nUp until the final moment, the Clintons had been trying to negotiate with the House Oversight Committee behind the scenes to find a way for Comer to spare them the contempt vote and lift the subpoenas. They said that Comer and the top Democrat on the panel could interview Bill Clinton under oath, an offer that the chair also rejected, insisting that the former president appear before the entire committee for an open-ended, transcribed interview.\nIn recent days, a member of the Clintons’ legal team went so far as to track down Comer’s cellphone number and reach out to resolve how the Clintons could answer his committee’s questions, according to a person familiar with the negotiations\nComer never responded.\nAnd even after the Clintons said they would agree to a transcript, Comer said there was no deal. The situation frustrated the Clintons and their allies.\nPhilippe Reines, a longtime adviser to the Clintons, said the House Democrats who sided with Republicans in January and voted in favor of recommending that the House hold the Clintons in contempt were to blame for the ultimate outcome.\n“Republicans are gonna Republican,” Reines said. “It’s the Democrats who are disappointing, navel gazing like this is a legitimate exercise in law and democracy.”\nHe derided Democrats who he said could raise money off their votes by telling donors that they “stand with MAGA in chanting ‘lock them up.’”\nNine Democrats on the Oversight Committee joined Republicans last month in support of holding Bill Clinton in contempt, while three Democrats backed holding Hillary Clinton in contempt, teeing up votes on the House floor.\nMany Democrats have been reluctant to be seen as defending anyone associated with the convicted sex offender — especially party figures who carry as much baggage as the Clintons.\nFor the Clintons, the entire saga was a continuation of the Republican assault on them that has been the background noise of their entire life on the national political stage.\nIn a letter they wrote to Comer in January, the Clintons accused him of potentially bringing Congress to a halt to pursue a politically driven process “literally designed to result in our imprisonment.”\n———\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n© 2026 The New York Times Company"

      "text": "The Clintons are political animals; everything they do is with a political strategy at the forefront of their thinking. What Bill and Hillary needed was to provide an excuse for Democrats on the House Oversight Committee to vote against holding them in contempt. That’s what Bill and Hillary have done.\nIn a somewhat opaque last-minute agreement to testify to the House about their involvement with Jeffrey Epstein, rules and limits still to be decided, Bill and Hillary Clinton have simply attempted to stop/stall the House from holding them in contempt.\nWASHINGTON DC – Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee as part of the panel’s investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nIt’s a remarkable reversal for the former president and secretary of state, who had defied committee-issued subpoenas and risked imprisonment by the Trump Justice Department as the House prepared to vote Wednesday to hold them in contempt of Congress.\nAfter both skipped their scheduled depositions earlier this year, the Oversight Committee voted on a bipartisan basis in January to approve a contempt measure for each of them.\nAlthough both have said they had no knowledge of Epstein’s crimes, they have maintained that the subpoenas were not tied to a legitimate legislative purpose, rendering them invalid. They also argued that the GOP-led exercise was designed to embarrass and put them in jail.\nIt is not immediately clear when they would appear and if the House will continue to go ahead with the contempt votes anyway.\n“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions,” House Oversight Chair James Comer said in a statement Monday. “The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt. I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.” (read more)\n“I don’t recall”. “I don’t remember it that way”. “I’ll take the 5th”. Those are going to be the answers. Remember that little tune Rush had on his radio show when hitlery was testifying before congress years ago? “….. My minds in blender, it’s jello”.\nRight.\nObviously Presidential timber.\nYup, that is what I expect. Just like the old show testimonies from the mobsters.\n“I did not have sexual relations on that island. Epstein island.”\nWhy am I featured in a blue dress? I don’t remember…..\n“…is, is.”\nAnd because they’re still married (on paper at least) they can’t be compelled to testify against each other.\nSee the clowns, ride the camels, breathe the helium!!! Come to the circus and enjoy the show!!!\n“At this point, what does it matter.”\n-HRC\nwhat difference does it make…hopefully seeing the former POTUS and first lady wearing orange….\nNeither will ever spend a day in jail.\nSo what? The goal is not to put people in jail but to win the midterms.\nAdd these optics to Ilhan et. al. and the Atlanta raid and what’s brewing in CA and you can see the noose formed by the smell of corruption that is beginning to tighten around the Democrats’ collective necks.\nI do hope you are correct.\nA mountain of corruption investigations and a few felonyy convictions, fraud, money laundering, media surveillance, the Jan 6 stuff.\nThe Dems see a major shitstorm brewing. Let it roll !\nI still want to see them in jail.\nPut them in the same cell.\nTHAT ought be entertaining.\nLOL\nSorry cas… putting corrupt politicians in jail will win the midterms… Being afraid to arrest, indict and put them on trial will lose the midterms…\nrosey glasses?\nnever fear, hell awaits them both. justice will come soon.\nBill’s nickname has been “slick Willie” since 1980 when he gave a speech at the state Democratic convention in Arkansas.\nThis is a joke and will and ammo for the Marxist for the midterms and republicans are working to sacrifice them.\nEveryone knows not one damn thing will come of this kabuki theatre.\nYou should listen to Dan Bongino, he would give you a downvote, TOO, if available.\nThis is beyond ridiculous.\nWe agree to the terms that we don’t understand.\n“You have to approve the bill, to see what’s inside”\nI hope the committee won’t ask Hillary and Bill about the Russia-gate hoax.\nHillary and Bill weren’t employed by the government when Trump ran for his first term.\nTheir staff made up the Russia-Trump collusion scandal. They exploited it to defeat Trump.\nBut, regardless their fake political hit job, American voters were ready for someone who was an outsider to government and a successful businessman.\nFrankly speaking, the American electorate have been waiting since Calvin Coolidge for a businessman to run the gummint.\nPoliticians shouldn’t be allowed to run anything. They already run off their mouths too much.\nIf they haven’t made payroll they are IMO unqualified.\nHillary was involved with providing FAKE evidence that was used to attempt to overthrow the gov’t….TREASON ..FOUR ILLEGAL FISA WARRANTS…both barry soetoro and hillary clinton, along with dozens more, knew those warrants were illegal and moved forward with them….TREASON\nI will take conviction on any of their many crimes, I just want to see them in orange jumpsuits. Hung for treason is probably outside the realm of possibilities. Personally, Obama did me the most harm by voiding catastrophic health insurance, when I was being rolled off Cobra. But, aside from him, Bill and Hill were disgusting.\nIt depends on what smashing your Obama SOS home server is!\nThis is a guy who couldn’t clearly agree to a definition of “is” so of course it is about the terms.\nSomewhere a moist, now mildewed cigar begs to differ, Bill.\nHaiti looks like it should be a Clinton refuge… should ease right in.\nThis is ridiculous at best. With all the crimes the Clinton’s have committed … easily provable in a court of law … this is what they’re subpoenaed for? It’s all a play for our benefit. Republicans are vile.\nnone of these oversight hearings have legal teeth w bondi in office, yet comer and his crew have wasted hundreds of millions in taxpayer moneys on them for dramatic theatre and reelection votes… clintons r pure evil\nThe Clinton’s contribution to US History has been documented. Nothing informative will come from anything the congress does.\nSince Republicans are incapable of doing anything useful, they’re gonna waste our time with this BS. They really are the stupid party.\nI know we’re supposed to pray for our enemies, but, oh, how I despise these two!\nOk:\nI pray they suffer an eternity of pain.\nMay God bless the Clinton’s and remove them speedily from any proximity to power over us or anyone but themselves.\nMay God bless the Bush’s and remove them speedily from any proximity to power over us or anyone other than themselves.\nMay God aid me in forgiving my enemies and May He forgive me my sins.\nThanks for reminding me, James.\nActs 26:18\nTo open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sin.\nI don’t know anything positive that could be an outcome.\nPerhaps if Hilldog gets thrown in the back of a van.\nThey are both traitors. They are both guilty of High Treason. This country can withstand enemies from the out side, these two are but a few of the enemies within the gates of this country. We are truly the Rome of our times. Eh Tu Brutus?\n“A nation can survive its fools, and even the ambitious. But it cannot survive treason from within. An enemy at the gates is less formidable, for he is known and carries his banner openly. But the traitor moves amongst those within the gate freely, his sly whispers rustling through all the alleys, heard in the very halls of government itself. For the traitor appears not a traitor; he speaks in accents familiar to his victims, and he wears their face and their arguments, he appeals to the baseness that lies deep in the hearts of all men. He rots the soul of a nation, he works secretly and unknown in the night to undermine the pillars of the city, he infects the body politic so that it can no longer resist. A murderer is less to fear.” ― Taylor Caldwell,\n“Taylor Caldwell”??? AKA: Marcus Tullius Cicero ???\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59099.A_Pillar_of_Iron\nWhen will people ever realize the Clintons and the Obama‘s are above the law? The Republicans are gonna wimp out as usual they will never hold them in contempt even with the majority, they will shoot themselves in the foot because of RINOS!\nThey will say “I don’t recall” a thousand times or they will plea the 5th.\n80 and 79 years of age. One more go at national attention, hopefully it will be humiliating and embarrassing for both of them!\nBill, can you explain to us this painting of you in a dress found on Epstein Island. Humiliation and embarrassment is all we can hope to happen to, BILL and HILLARY CLINTON.\nBut Gods judgment is in their future and not too far off being they are 80 and 79.\nYes, theater of the decrepit. Both sides. Sundance has shown us time & time again how useless these congressional testimonies are. At least on the GOPe are. Dems are more effective. Take Navarro & Bannon for instance.\nThere must be a parody in here somewhere.\nSame answers as George Crapanopolous gave years ago.\nMay they, jointly and severally, rot in prison. Other than that, “Saul Goodman”.\nAlternatively, since they have had such a successful relationship with Haiti, deport them there.\nIf happens … It will be the typical Clinton testimony.\nIt will not be sworn testimony.\nThe two standard answers: “I do not remember” and the taking the 5th.\nBut hey … they will be then be able to claim they “testified”.\nEvidence has been gathered.\nNo date is known on a (separate) appearance to Congress.\nThere is an opportunity to add clarity to the evidence, but\nthe politicians ( pro dc obfuscators gallore / training video )\nwill not volunteer clarity of truth\nwhile playing pretend with an assortment of words, (not actions)\nto maybe avoid a contempt of congress aye vote\n(which would go on their public record, pending a future pardon / expunging of record ).\nTheir appearance(s) (separately)\nwould be intended to go towards changing the minds of a few congress people, or not,\nprior to a vote on contempt of Congress.\nEvidence has already been gathered.\nimho\nLove thy neighbors\nThe notion that justice might come from a Congressional hearing is, quite frankly, insanity. The People want prosecutions; the politicians want the Peoples’ votes; the Clinton’s want to avoid jail…it’s all legal theatre.\nTake the vote.\nIt’s all about the process, never the crime. That’s the “punishment”.\nIt depends on what the meaning of the word ‘is’ is,”\n“At this point, what does my testimony matter?”\nGood to see the Clintons still control every situation. Tells us the uni party is still in control. Which means the doj, fbi and treasury are still corrupt.\nClock is ticking while doj spokesperson Bondi continues incompetently.\nSlick willy says, “It depends on what is…is.”\nHillery says, “It takes a village.”\nSo my conclusion:\nIs you is or is you ain’t gonna testify?\nThe village people of DC will not isatate to help you.\nAlot of rules in place to keep her from answering ANY questions about Russian Collusion scam… That’s what they want limits on…\nThe Clinton’s won’t remember anything."

      "text": "Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to appear for in-person depositions in Washington, DC, as part of the congressional probe into Jeffrey Epstein, CNN reported Monday.\nThe decision came at the last moment as the couple sought to avoid a House vote on contempt of Congress.\nEarlier in the day, House Oversight Chairman James Comer rejected a last-minute proposal from the Clintons’ attorneys that included several conditions. In a letter, Comer wrote, “It has been nearly six months since your clients first received the Committee’s subpoena, more than three months since the original date of their depositions, and nearly three weeks since they failed to appear for their depositions commensurate with the Committee’s lawful subpoenas. Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency.\"\nCorrespondence obtained by CNN showed that the Clintons’ legal team had been seeking a way out for days. Their attorneys have held multiple discussions with the Republican-led committee since lawmakers from both parties voted in January to hold the Clintons in contempt for refusing to appear for in-person depositions.\nBy rejecting the initial offer, Comer had set the stage for a final House vote on the contempt resolutions this week.\nAccording to a January 31 letter, the Clintons’ lawyers proposed that former President Bill Clinton sit for a voluntary, transcribed interview in New York City for four hours, limited to the scope of the Epstein probe. Lawmakers from both parties could ask questions, and both sides could have their own transcriber present. The attorneys also pushed for the committee to drop its subpoena for Hillary Clinton, though they said she could submit a second sworn declaration or appear for an in-person interview under similar terms.\nIn exchange, Clinton attorneys Ashley Callen and David E. Kendall asked Comer to withdraw the subpoenas and contempt resolutions.\nComer rejected the offer as “unreasonable,\" saying he could not agree to replace a sworn deposition with a voluntary interview or accept limits on questioning. He noted that if the attorneys had offered a voluntary interview when the subpoena was first issued in August, the situation might have unfolded differently.\nHe added that Clinton would have incentive to “run out the clock\" under a fixed four-hour limit and questioned why the Clintons wanted their own transcriber when an official court reporter would be present.\nBill Clinton has repeatedly denied wrongdoing related to Epstein."

James Comer, Monday evening to say that the couple would sit for interviews. If the testimony does happen, it will be one of only a few times a former president has been called before Congress.\nThe Clintons have spent months fighting the panel’s subpoena.\nOversight Committee Republicans, along with the support of a handful of Democrats, voted on Jan. 21 to hold both Clintons in contempt of Congress for failing to appear before the committee, prompting a last-ditch effort to negotiate terms.\nIn a letter on Saturday to Comer, which was obtained by The New York Times, Bill Clinton’s lawyer asked that the former president only appear for a four-hour transcribed interview. In the case of Hillary Clinton, lawyers argued that because she never met or spoke with Epstein, she should be allowed to submit a sworn declaration in place of testimony.\nComer rejected the offer in a response to the attorneys, calling it “unreasonable” and claiming that the requests amounted to special privileges.\n“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions,” Comer said in a statement to NOTUS. “The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt. I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”\nA former president has never testified before Congress for a criminal case of this magnitude.\nPresident Donald Trump was successful in avoiding answering his 2022 subpoena by the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, ultimately getting it withdrawn through litigation.\n“Long-held precedent and practice maintain that separation of powers prohibits Congress from compelling a President to testify before it,” Trump’s attorney argued at the time.\nThe House Rules Committee was scheduled to hold a vote Monday to approve the contempt charges against the Clintons. But the panel’s chair, Rep. Virginia Foxx, moved to postpone the vote, saying that given the Clintons’ agreement to testify, she would grant more time for the Oversight Committee and the Clintons to agree to terms.\n“Obviously there’s a lot of ongoing discussions and negotiations,” Foxx said Monday night after hours of debate. “I think we need more time to clarify with the Clintons what they are actually agreeing to. Accordingly, the committee will postpone further consideration of the contempt. However, should there not be substantial compliance and agreement overnight, the committee will return to continue the hearing on the contempt.”\nSpeaking from Capitol Hill on Monday, the Oversight Committee’s ranking member, Rep. Robert Garcia, said that for the contempt vote not to be withdrawn now that the Clintons have accepted the committee’s terms “would be insane.”\n“That would be unprecedented,” Garcia said. “It would be clearly a demonstration that Comer is actually not interested in hearing from the Clintons, that he’s only interested in political games and not actually getting the truth, and I think that would be a huge disservice to the survivors and to the investigation.”\nSign in\nLog into your free account with your email.

Historically, Congress has given deference to former presidents. None has ever been forced to testify before lawmakers, although a few have voluntarily done so.\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said earlier Monday that his caucus would have a discussion on the contempt resolutions later in the week but remained noncommittal on whipping votes against them.\nJeffries said he was a “hard no” on contempt and accused Comer of focusing on political retribution rather than investigating the delayed release of case files. Democrats also say the Justice Department has not yet released all the material it has on the late financier.\n“They don’t want a serious interview, they want a charade,” Jeffries said."

      "text": "Clintons raise white flag after months-long battle to avoid testifying on Epstein\nWashington: Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify in the House oversight committee’s investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, capitulating to the demands of the panel’s Republican chair days before the House was set to vote to hold the couple in criminal contempt of Congress.\nFor months, the Clintons were adamant that they would not comply with subpoenas from congressman James Comer, the panel’s Republican chair, that they described as invalid and legally unenforceable. They accused Comer of being part of a plot to target them as US President Donald Trump’s political adversaries and promised to fight him on the issue for as long as it took.\nBut after some Democrats on the panel joined Republicans in a vote to recommend charging them with criminal contempt, an extraordinary first step in referring them to the Department of Justice for prosecution, the Clintons ultimately waved the white flag and agreed to fully comply with Comer’s demands.\nIn an email sent to Comer on Monday evening (Tuesday AEDT), attorneys for the Clintons said their clients would “appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates” and asked that the House not move forward with a contempt vote, which had been slated for Wednesday.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” spokespeople for the Clintons said in a statement. “They told under oath what they know, but you did not care. But the former president and former secretary of state will be there.”\nFor Bill Clinton to testify in the Epstein investigation would be nearly unprecedented. No former president has appeared before Congress since 1983, when Gerald Ford did so to discuss the celebration of the 1987 bicentennial of the enactment of the Constitution. When Trump was subpoenaed in 2022 by the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol – after he had left office – he sued the panel to try to block it. The panel ultimately withdrew the subpoena.\nThe Clintons’ move capped a months-long battle between them and Comer. It was a victory for the Republican chair’s efforts to shift the focus of his panel’s Epstein investigation away from Trump’s ties to Epstein and the president’s administration’s handling of the matter, and onto prominent Democrats who once associated with the disgraced financier and his long-time companion, Ghislaine Maxwell.\nIn a letter on Saturday to Comer, obtained by The New York Times, Bill Clinton’s lawyers tried one more time to put some guardrails on potential interviews with the Clintons. They said Bill Clinton would agree to sit for a four-hour transcribed interview with the entire committee – something he had previously described as an inappropriate and unprecedented request to make of a former president.\nThe lawyers asked that Hillary Clinton, who has said she never met or spoke to Epstein, be allowed to make a sworn declaration instead of testifying. But they said that she, too, would submit to an in-person interview if the committee insisted on it, “with appropriate adjustments for the paucity of information she has to offer in this matter”, according to the letter.\nBut Comer flatly rejected the offer, calling it “unreasonable” and arguing that four hours of testimony from Bill Clinton was inadequate given that he was a “loquacious individual” who might seek to run out the clock.\n“Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency,” Comer wrote in a letter sent to the Clintons’ lawyers on Monday that was also obtained by the Times.\nIn that letter, Comer also rejected the demand from Bill Clinton that the scope of the interview be limited to matters related to Epstein. Comer said the former president “likely has an artificially narrow definition in mind” of what matters would be related to the Epstein investigation.\nComer said he had concerns that Clinton would refuse to answer questions about “his personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, ways in which they sought to curry favour with powerful individuals and alleged efforts to utilise his power and influence after his presidency to kill negative news stories about Jeffrey Epstein”.\nIn response to Comer’s letter, the Clintons on Monday evening agreed to all of Comer’s demands, removing any time limit on the deposition of Bill Clinton or on the range of topics that Republicans could ask him about.\nThe only point of negotiation that Comer had previously been amenable to was conducting the interviews in New York, where the Clintons live and work.\nBill Clinton was acquainted with Epstein, who died in prison in 2019, but has said he never visited Epstein’s private island and cut off contact with him two decades ago. Clinton took four international trips on Epstein’s private jet in 2002 and 2003, according to flight logs.\nWhile some House Democrats last month voted with Republicans to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress, others expressed disgust at the entire situation, and in particular about the inclusion of Hillary Clinton.\n“I’m not seeing anything to suggest she ought to be a part of this in any way,” congressman Kweisi Mfume said at a hearing last month. He noted that it looked like the former secretary of state had been included because “we want to dust her up a bit if we get her before this committee”.\nThe offer from the Clintons represented a total surrender after they made a defiant stand just weeks ago, vowing to fight back against an investigation they said was unfairly targeting them and holding them to a different standard from others.\n“Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences,” the Clintons wrote in a lengthy letter to Comer on January 13. “For us, now is that time.”\nUp to the final moment, the Clintons had tried to negotiate with the House oversight committee behind the scenes to find a way for Comer to spare them the contempt vote and lift the subpoenas. They said Comer and the top Democrat on the panel could interview Bill Clinton under oath, an offer that the chair also rejected, because he insisted the former president appear before the entire committee for an open-ended, transcribed interview.\nFor the Clintons, the entire saga was a continuation of the Republican assault on them that has been the background noise of their entire life on the national political stage.\nIn the January letter, the Clintons accused Comer of potentially bringing Congress to a halt to pursue a politically driven process “literally designed to result in our imprisonment”.\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\nGet a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what’s making headlines around the world.

      "text": "WASHINGTON — Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed late Monday to testify in a House investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the Republican leading the probe said an agreement had not yet been finalized.\nRep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, was advancing criminal contempt of Congress charges against both Clintons Monday evening for defying a congressional subpoena when attorneys for the Clintons emailed staff for the Oversight panel, saying the pair would accept Comer’s demands and “will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.”\nThe attorneys requested that Comer, a Kentucky Republican, agree not to move forward with the contempt proceedings. Comer, however, said he was not immediately dropping the charges, which would carry the threat of a substantial fine and even incarceration if passed by the House and successfully prosecuted by the Department of Justice.\n“We don’t have anything in writing,” Comer told reporters, adding that he was open to accepting the Clintons’ offer but “it depends on what they say.”\nThe last-minute negotiating came as Republican leaders were advancing the contempt resolution through the House Rules Committee — a final hurdle before it headed to the House floor for a vote. It was potentially a grave moment for Congress, the first time it could hold a former president in contempt and advance the threat of prison time.\nComer earlier Monday rejected an offer from attorneys for the Clintons to have Bill Clinton conduct a transcribed interview and Hillary Clinton submit a sworn declaration. He insisted that both Clintons sit for sworn depositions before the committee in order to fulfill the panel’s subpoenas.\nA letter from the committee to attorneys for the Clintons indicated that they had offered for Bill Clinton to conduct a 4-hour transcribed interview on “matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein” and for Hillary Clinton to submit a sworn declaration.\n“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer said.\nThe former president and secretary of state had resisted the subpoenas for months after the Oversight panel issued subpoenas for their testimony in August as it opened an investigation into Epstein and his associates. Their attorneys had tried to argue against the validity of the subpoena.\nHowever, as Comer threatened to begin contempt of Congress proceedings, the Clintons started negotiating towards a compromise. The Republican-controlled Oversight committee advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges last month. Nine of the committee’s 21 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the charges against Bill Clinton as they argued for full transparency in the Epstein investigation. Three Democrats also supported advancing the charges against Hillary Clinton.\nBill Clinton’s relationship with Epstein has reemerged as a focal point for Republicans amid the push for a reckoning over Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell as he faced sex trafficking charges.\nClinton, like a bevy of other high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier.\nThe Clintons have remained highly critical of Comer’s decision, saying he was bringing politics into the investigation while failing to hold the Trump administration accountable for delays in producing the Department of Justice’s case files on Epstein.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” a spokesperson for the Clintons, Angel Ureña, said in response to Comer’s threats on Monday. “They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care.”\nStill, the prospect of a vote raised the potential for Congress to use one of its most severe punishments against a former president for the first time. Historically, Congress has given deference to former presidents. None has ever been forced to testify before lawmakers, although a few have voluntarily done so.\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said earlier Monday that his caucus would have a discussion on the contempt resolutions later in the week but remained noncommittal on whipping votes against them.\nJeffries said he was a “hard no” on contempt and accused Comer of focusing on political retribution rather than investigating the delayed release of case files. Democrats also say the Justice Department has not yet released all the material it has on the late financier.\n“They don’t want a serious interview, they want a charade,” Jeffries said."

They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone,” the Clintons’ deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said in a post on social media.\nUrena posted the announcement above a House Oversight Committee statement from earlier on Monday that accused the Clintons of “defying lawful subpoenas” and of “trying to dodge contempt by requesting special treatment”.\n“The Clintons are not above the law,” the Oversight Committee said.\nLast week, the Oversight Committee recommended the couple be held in contempt for refusing to testify about their relationship with Epstein.\nThe Clintons had offered to cooperate with the committee’s probe into Epstein, but refused to appear in person, saying the investigation was a partisan exercise aimed at protecting President Donald Trump, who was a longtime friend of Epstein.\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson welcomed the news from the Clintons, but did not say whether the chamber would drop its planned contempt vote.\n“That’s a good development,” he said. “We expect everyone to comply with Congress’s subpoenas.”\nDemocrats say the House probe is being weaponised to attack political opponents of Trump – who has not been called to testify despite being long associated with Epstein – rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.\nTrump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, but pressure from his Make America Great Again (MAGA) base and some Republican lawmakers forced the president to order the release of millions of documents in the case.\nBill Clinton flew on Epstein’s plane several times in the early 2000s after leaving office. He has expressed regret about the relationship and said he knew nothing about Epstein’s criminal activity.\nHillary Clinton said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his private island.\nThe Epstein affair continues to cast a long shadow over US politics, and now, the United Kingdom’s, entangling prominent figures including the disgraced former-prince Andrew and ex-UK ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson.\nUK police said on Monday they are reviewing reports of alleged misconduct involving Mandelson, whose name surfaced more than 5,000 times in the US Justice Department files on Epstein.\nThe veteran British politician was fired as ambassador to the US last year after emails came to light that showed him calling Epstein “my best pal” and advising him on seeking early release from prison.\nMandelson has apologised to Epstein’s victims and denied wrongdoing."

Some officials have refused to testify before Congress before and whether or not this results in imprisonment has to do with whether the refusee is a Republican or a Democrat. Still even the Democrats had better legal reasoning than the hodge-podge of pulpit-pounding and arm-waving in the Clinton rejection letter that read like it had been written by Hillary Clinton in a foul mood and no one to tell her it was a bad idea. (“You can’t tell me how to lawyer, I was lawyering when you were in diapers.”)\nEventually their high-priced legal talent prevailed on Hillary to back down.\n2. The Epstein files are out and the Clinton takeaway is that they have nothing to worry about.\nMy money is on a mix of 1 and 2, but especially 2.\nSo here we go.\nBill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee as part of the panel’s investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nIt’s a remarkable reversal for the former president and secretary of state, who had defied committee-issued subpoenas and risked imprisonment by the Trump Justice Department as the House prepared to vote Wednesday to hold them in contempt of Congress.\n“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions,” House Oversight Chair James Comer said in a statement Monday. “The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt. I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”\nComer’s office received an email from the Clintons’ legal team announcing the couple’s decision while he was in the middle of testifying before the House Rules Committee to tee up consideration of the contempt resolutions in the coming days, according to a GOP committee aide.\nAgreeing to agree and then negotiating terms is how properly trained lawyers, which Hillary hasn’t been in a while, handle something like this. Mostly though the end game is the Clintons showing up, delivering their prepared speeches and Hillary closing with “Well what difference does it make anyway?”\nJeff Bargholz says\nWe all know the criminal Clintons will lie their asses off as usual and run down the clocks on the house questioners and get away with it. Like you wrote, they’re D-Bags, so they’re above the law, like Lois Lerner, Eric Holder, et al. Only Republicans like Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon go to jail for defying Congress. But then, they defied criminal D-Bags, not weak ass Republicans.\n“Nobody is above the law” Countless D-Bag politicians say that regularly. As always, they’re full of shit.\nMeanwhile, they’re still trying and failing to incriminate President Trump of being Jeffrey Epstain’s pal and hanging out at Pederast Island. Never mind that they know he’s never been there and hated Epstain. Never mind that Billdo Clinton flew there 27 times and there are photos of young sex slaves sitting on his lap. And don’t get me started on Bill STD Gates and his diseased dingus (as described by his vile associates,) or that royal inbred, Pederast Prince Andrew.\nThe Dirtbagocrat party trull is depraved, despicable and disgusting.\nMuggsSpongedice says\nBro Jeff, you should be a syndicated columnist.

The criminally insane let out of mental hospitals and prisons, cartel gang bangers and jihad terrorists with the mindset and actual culture that looks at girls and women as lower than dogs and to be brutally disrespectful that silencing them is no problem after you beat them and raped them that flooded into the USA under the coup d’etat of installed Autopen.\nAnyway, just saying.

      "text": "Former US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state, have agreed to testify before Congress as part of the investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a move that comes after weeks of legal sparring and political accusations.\nConfirmation came from Bill Clinton’s former deputy chief of staff, who wrote on social media: “The former President and former Secretary of State will be there.” The decision follows mounting pressure from the Republican-led US House of Representatives, which had been preparing to vote on holding both Clintons in criminal contempt for allegedly defying subpoenas.\nThe development is significant not just politically, but historically. While the exact timing of the depositions remains unclear, it will mark the first time a former US president has testified before a congressional committee since Gerald Ford did so in 1983.\nThe House Oversight Committee, chaired by Republicans, approved contempt measures against the Clintons late last month, with backing from several Democrats. At the time, committee chairman James Comer said “no-one is above the law.” Republicans argue the subpoenas were issued fairly and in a bipartisan manner, and that the Clintons repeatedly delayed compliance.\nThe Clintons, however, have pushed back strongly. Their lawyers described the subpoenas as “unenforceable” and said the couple had already provided the “limited information” they possessed about Epstein. The former president and former secretary of state also dismissed the summonses as “nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals, as President Trump has directed”.\nQuick Reads\nView AllOn Monday evening, Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña confirmed on X that the couple would now appear before the panel.\nThey negotiated in good faith. You did not.\n— Angel Ureña (@angelurena) February 2, 2026\nThey told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care.\nBut the former President and former Secretary of State will be there.\nThey look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone. https://t.co/iO67XjNFsT\nBill Clinton’s association with Epstein\nBill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein’s abuse and has consistently denied any knowledge of Epstein’s sex crimes. Both Clintons maintain they do not have information relevant to the investigation and say they previously submitted sworn statements to the committee.\nBill Clinton appears in photographs with Epstein that were released by the Department of Justice after Congress passed a law mandating the disclosure of materials related to Epstein investigations. One image shows Clinton swimming in a pool, while another shows him reclining in what appears to be a hot tub. Ureña said the photos were decades old and that Clinton had cut ties with Epstein long before his crimes became public.\nLast month, the Clintons wrote directly to Comer, sharply criticising his handling of the probe. “The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government’s role,” the letter said. They added: “There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics.”\nComer, for his part, has rejected those claims. “We communicated with President Clinton’s legal team for months now, giving them opportunity after opportunity to come in, to give us a day, and they continue to delay, delay, delay,” said the Kentucky Republican."

They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nAccording to a committee letter sent to the Clintons’ lawyers, the couple had previously offered alternatives.

The lawyers are looking into the details,\" he told the Reuters news agency.\nThe House Oversight Committee recommended last week that both Bill and Hillary Clinton be held in contempt for refusing to testify about their relationship with Epstein.\nThe Clintons had offered to cooperate with the panel but had refused to appear in person, calling the investigation a partisan exercise aimed at protecting Republican president Donald Trump.\n\"They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care,\" the Clintons's deputy chief of staff Angel Ureña said in a post on social media.\n\"But the former president and former secretary of state will be there.

      "text": "Clintons to testify in Epstein case: Everything new files reveal about Bill and Hillary\nBill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before a congressional panel investigating links to Jeffrey Epstein.\nFormer US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before a congressional panel examining links to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, amid escalating political and legal pressure, according to reports.\nThe agreement follows months of standoff between the Clintons’ legal team and the Republican-led House Oversight Committee, which had issued subpoenas seeking testimony. Late last month, the committee approved a measure to hold both Clintons in criminal contempt, a step supported by several Democrats, reports indicated.\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer said the action was intended to reinforce that “no one is above the law,” noting that lawmakers had repeatedly sought cooperation from Clinton’s attorneys over an extended period.\nConfirmation of testimony\nConfirmation that the Clintons would appear came Monday, when Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said on social media that both would testify before the committee. Ureña said the couple had negotiated “in good faith” and accused the panel of acting politically rather than seeking facts.\nHe added that the Clintons had already testified under oath about what they knew and said they welcomed the opportunity to establish standards that apply uniformly.\nWhat newly released files show\nThe scrutiny comes after the US Department of Justice released Epstein-related materials under a law passed by Congress. After leaving office, the former president spent time socially with Epstein and traveled multiple times on his private jet in the early 2000s. Images released by the Justice Department show Clinton swimming and appearing alongside women whose identities have been obscured.\nAdditional images released show Clinton reportedly cutting a slice of cake for a woman aboard what appears to be a private jet, with other guests nearby.\nWhile Clinton's presence in the files has drawn attention, he has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Notably, he has never been accused by Epstein’s victims and has said he had no knowledge of Epstein’s sex crimes at the time.\nThere are currently no reports from major international news outlets or official government sources indicating that Hillary Clinton is named or implicated in the recently released 2026 Epstein files.\nClintons’ response to allegations\nWhen the photographs were made public, Clinton’s spokesman said they were decades old and that Clinton had ended his association with Epstein well before the financier’s criminal conduct became widely known.\nHe said that the former president had traveled on Epstein’s aircraft in the early 2000s for work connected to the Clinton Foundation, before Epstein faced any criminal charges related to sexual abuse.\nLawyers for the Clintons have also maintained that the subpoenas were unenforceable and argued that the couple had already provided all relevant information in their possession, as per reports.\nIt is unclear whether the House will proceed with the planned contempt vote now that the Clintons have agreed to testify. The Oversight Committee has said it will continue pursuing testimony it believes is necessary as part of its investigation, reports indicated.\n- ABOUT THE AUTHORPrakriti Deb\nPrakriti Deb is a journalist with the US Desk at Hindustan Times.

      "text": "Clintons agree to testify to House Oversight Committee ahead of expected contempt vote\nWashington — Bill and Hillary Clinton agreed to testify in the House Oversight Committee's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, ahead of expected votes in the House later this week on holding the pair in contempt of Congress.\nIn an email to the committee on Monday, the Clintons' legal team said the former president and former secretary of state \"accept the terms of your letter and will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.\"\n\"As has been the Committee's practice, please confirm the House will not move forward with contempt proceedings, as the Chairman stated in his letter this morning,\" said the email, which was obtained by CBS News.\nRepublican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, who chairs the oversight panel, said in a statement late Monday: \"The Clintons' counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions. The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt. I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.\"\nOn Tuesday, the Oversight Committee gave the Clintons a noon deadline to confirm that they were agreeing to transcribed, taped depositions with no limits on how long the deposition would last, according to a source familiar with the matter. The House will move forward if the Clintons fail to comply, the source said.\nThe House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Clintons last year, but the pair called the subpoenas legally invalid and refused to appear before the panel, which is probing the Justice Department's investigations into Epstein. The committee then recommended holding the Clintons in contempt in January.\nBoth contempt resolutions advanced out of the House Oversight Committee with bipartisan support, though more Democrats supported the one related to Bill Clinton, who has acknowledged previous interactions with Epstein.\nNeither Clinton has been accused of any wrongdoing in the Epstein case.\nIn an effort to avoid the contempt of Congress votes, lawyers for the Clintons said in a Jan. 31 letter to the committee that the former president would agree to sit for a four-hour transcribed interview if it takes place in New York City and is \"confined to matters related to the investigations and prosecutions\" of Epstein. The former secretary of state would offer another sworn declaration to answer any questions the committee still has, the lawyers said. If the committee still requires her in-person testimony, her appearance should follow the same terms as her husband's testimony, they said.\nThe Clintons' legal team asked that the subpoenas and contempt resolutions be withdrawn if the conditions were agreed to.\nResponding in a letter earlier Monday, Comer said the panel has \"serious concerns\" about the offer.\nComer argued the proposed scope of Bill Clinton's testimony was too limited and \"would result in your client answering few questions.\" The other demands were \"not reasonable\" and \"insufficient,\" Comer said. Comer said the terms proposed for Hillary Clinton's sworn declaration or appearance were also unacceptable.\nThe news of the Clintons' offer was first delivered by Democratic Rep. James Walkinshaw of Virginia during Monday night's House Rules Committee meeting, which was expected to advance the contempt resolutions and tee them up for floor votes in the coming days.\n\"I understand that the Clintons have agreed to appear for depositions and have agreed to the terms that you laid out in your most recent letter,\" Walkinshaw told Comer as they both appeared before the committee.\nComer said he was unaware of the news. The Clintons' attorney had emailed the committee with the offer while Comer was testifying, according to a committee aide.\nComer left the House Rules Committee, which briefly recessed for floor votes Monday, questioning the Clintons' agreement.\n\"There is no offer. They texted us and said they accept our offer. There is no offer,\" he told reporters. \"What do they accept? … They said they would accept my offer. They sent an offer, and I rejected their offer.\"\nRep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the Clintons have now accepted \"every single request\" from Republicans on the terms of their testimony and urged Comer to respond with dates for their appearance.\n\"We're going to find out right now if Chairman Comer actually wants to hear from the Clintons, or this is all a political, partisan witch hunt by Donald Trump,\" Garcia told reporters Monday night.\nGOP Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the chairwoman of the House Rules Committee, said later Monday night that the panel would postpone further consideration of the contempt resolutions until it's clarified \"with the Clintons what they are actually agreeing to.\"\n\"However, should there not be substantial compliance and agreement overnight, the committee will return to continue the hearing on the contempt,\" she said.\nThe House Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Clintons in August, along with former Justice Department officials dating back to George W. Bush's administration. Since then, only Bill Barr, who served as attorney general during President Trump's first term, has provided closed-door testimony to the committee, while the panel has accepted written statements from the others.\nComer has said the committee accepted statements from other former officials because they weren't photographed with Epstein or his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, \"nor is there any evidence that they were directly involved in the investigation.\"\nThe Clintons have accused Comer of treating them differently than other officials in an attempt to embarrass them and punish Mr. Trump's political rivals.\nThe Justice Department released a massive trove of Epstein files last week that include mentions of a number of notable figures, including Bill Clinton and Mr. Trump.\nMr. Trump has also not been accused of any wrongdoing as it relates to the Epstein case."

      "text": "WASHINGTON D.C (VINnews) – Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify before the House Oversight Committee in its investigation into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, averting a potential contempt of Congress vote.\nJoin our WhatsApp groupSubscribe to our Daily Roundup Email\nThe announcement came Monday evening from Angel Ureña, deputy chief of staff to Bill Clinton, who posted on X that “the former President and former Secretary of State will be there.” Ureña added that the Clintons “negotiated in good faith” and “look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nThe House Oversight Committee, chaired by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., had subpoenaed the Clintons last year as part of its probe into Epstein’s activities, including what they may have known about Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The committee has examined connections to high-profile figures amid ongoing scrutiny of Epstein’s sex-trafficking network.\nThe Clintons had previously resisted in-person appearances, offering alternatives such as transcribed interviews or sworn declarations, while arguing the subpoenas were part of a partisan effort. They defied initial deposition dates, leading the committee — with some bipartisan support — to approve recommendations last month to hold them in criminal contempt of Congress. A full House vote on contempt had been expected as early as Wednesday.\nThe reversal follows months of negotiations and comes just days before the contempt measure was set to advance. Committee aides confirmed the agreement, though details on deposition dates remain to be finalized.\nBill Clinton’s name has appeared in previously released Epstein-related documents, though he has consistently denied any knowledge of or involvement in Epstein’s crimes. Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state included oversight of U.S. efforts to combat international sex trafficking, which the committee has also scrutinized.\nThe Oversight Committee’s investigation continues amid broader congressional and public interest in Epstein’s case following the release of additional files by the Justice Department. No dates for the Clintons’ testimony have been publicly set.\nBe prepared to see the Master of b.s., bob and weave, while technically denying that he was a part of any illegalities committed. By the time he is finished, he will try to have us believe that he was there to obtain support for his charities.\nI really don’t understand what is their connection with Epstein and why they do not want to testify.\nNow subpoena Trump. When he lies, we will have the millionth reason to impeach him. For those who forget , Clinton testified when he was president.\nThe two of them will lie their heads off, as is their modus operandi."

They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone,\" Angel Urena said on X. The House Rules Committee had advanced resolutions accusing the Clintons of defying subpoenas to appear in person to explain their links to Epstein, who died in custody in 2019.\nThe Epstein affair continues to cast a long shadow over Washington, entangling some of the most prominent names in US politics and highlighting the sharp partisan battles that have shaped the scandal.\nDemocrats say the probe is being weaponized to attack political opponents of President Donald Trump – himself a longtime Epstein associate who has not been called to testify – rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.\nTrump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.\nDemocratic divisions\nNeither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities. In letters where they initially refused to appear in Washington, the Clintons argued that the subpoenas were invalid because they lacked a clear legislative purpose.\nRepublicans say the Democratic couple's past links to the business tycoon, including Bill Clinton's use of his private jet in the early 2000s, justify in-person questioning under oath. Instead, the couple submitted sworn written statements describing their knowledge of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\nBill Clinton acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited his private island. Hillary Clinton said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.\nThe contempt vote and its targeting of the Clintons could have exposed divisions among congressional Democrats. Some Democrats have privately acknowledged that their party has long argued no one should be beyond scrutiny in efforts to uncover the full scope of Epstein's crimes. But others feared that advancing the contempt resolutions would have played into a partisan strategy to shift attention away from Trump's past contacts with Epstein.\nThe Justice Department released last week what it said would be the final batch of files related to the investigation into Epstein."

Bill Clinton will sit for deposition the following day, Feb. 27.\n\"The Clintons completely caved and will appear for transcribed, filmed depositions this month. We look forward to questioning the Clintons as part of our investigation into the horrific crimes of Epstein and Maxwell, to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people and for survivors,\" Comer, a Republican, wrote in a statement.\nEarlier Tuesday, Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill, in a post on X, called for the Clintons to testify in a public hearing instead of appearing for a deposition, writing: \"At the 11th hour, James Comer asked for a camera, that’s fine. He can have 1,000 cameras. The Clintons will do this publicly.\"\nA letter from the Clintons' attorney Jon Skladany to Comer also said an open hearing \"will best suit our concerns about fairness,\" citing the requirement that the interviews be videotaped — but ultimately left the decision about whether to hold a hearing or a deposition up to Comer.\n“Please let us know the date and time for the hearing, or which pair of deposition dates the Chairman prefers,” Skladany wrote.\nThe Clintons' realization that a deposition would be recorded on video should not come as a surprise. The subpoenas issued by Congress explicitly called for depositions, and the House’s depositions rules, direct the committee chair to \"ensure that the testimony is transcribed and may also require testimony to be electronically recorded, including by video recording.\"\nA Republican aide said that these depositions will be conducted behind closed doors, not public hearings. The aide added that a location for the depositions is still \"TBD\" as the Clintons push for them to take place in New York City.\nComer had set a noon deadline Tuesday for the Clintons to agree to the GOP's specific terms for depositions, warning that if they did not then Republicans would reconvene to move contempt resolutions toward a full House vote.\n\"They negotiated in good faith. You did not,\" Clinton spokesperson Angel Ureña posted on X on Monday. \"They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"\nLast month, the House Oversight Committee voted to advance two bipartisan resolutions holding the Clintons in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with its subpoenas relating to Epstein.\nFor months, the Clintons had insisted that the subpoenas were without legal merit. Comer had pushed back, saying the Clintons are not above the law and must comply with a subpoena.\nBesides defying the subpoenas to testify before the House committee, neither Bill Clinton nor Hillary Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing and both deny having any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. No Epstein survivor or associate has ever made a public allegation of wrongdoing or inappropriate behavior by the former president or his wife in connection with his prior relationship with Epstein.\nThis story has been updated with additional information from a lawyer for the Clintons."

They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"\nThe couple had originally refused to appear before lawmakers examining how authorities handled earlier investigations into the deceased financier, who had connections and correspondence with the world's business and political elite.\nDemocrats say the probe is being weaponized to attack political opponents of Trump -- himself a longtime Epstein associate who has not been called to testify -- rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.\nTrump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.\nNeither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.\nIn letters where they initially refused to appear in Washington, the Clintons had argued that the subpoenas were invalid because they lacked a clear legislative purpose.\nRepublicans say the Democratic couple's past links to the business tycoon, including Bill Clinton's use of his private jet in the early 2000s, justify in‑person questioning under oath.\nInstead, the couple submitted sworn written statements describing their knowledge of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.\nBill Clinton acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited his private island.\nHillary Clinton said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.\nAfter the Clintons agreed to testify, the Rules Committee decided Monday evening to suspend its vote on the contempt proceedings.\nrle-cl/ane/ami"

      "text": "After months of defiance, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to comply with the House’s Jeffrey Epstein investigation.\nFor months, the Clintons refused to honor subpoenas from the Republican-led House Oversight Committee, arguing the demands were invalid and politically motivated.\nDespite the Clintons’ offer to testify, House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer rejected the proposal Monday and dismissed it as insufficient. Comer signaled he would move ahead with efforts to hold Bill Clinton in criminal contempt of Congress as the Epstein probe advances.\nComer has repeatedly warned that the House Oversight Committee would pursue contempt charges if the Clintons failed to comply with its subpoenas. The committee issued the subpoenas in August 2025, and Comer said he would move forward with contempt after the Clintons skipped scheduled depositions.\nIn a Saturday letter The New York Times obtained, the Clintons’ lawyers told Comer that Bill Clinton would sit for a four-hour, transcribed interview before the full committee, despite previously calling such a demand inappropriate for a former president. The lawyers asked that Hillary Clinton submit a sworn declaration instead of testifying, while saying she would appear in person if required.\nComer called the Clintons’ proposal unreasonable and said four hours would not suffice for Bill Clinton, whom he described as a “loquacious” witness who could try to run out the clock. In the letter, Comer said the Clintons’ push for special treatment “frustrates” the public and undermines Americans’ demand for transparency, The New York Times reported.\nComer also rejected Bill Clinton’s demand to confine the interview to narrowly defined Epstein-related topics, saying the former president likely applied a limited view of what the probe covers. Comer said he worries Clinton would dodge questions about his relationship with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, including whether they cultivated influential figures or used Clinton’s post-presidency clout to suppress damaging coverage.\nThe Clintons’ offer to testify reflects a reversal from their defiant stance just weeks earlier, when they vowed to fight what they described as a politically-driven investigation. Behind the scenes, their legal team sought to negotiate with the House Oversight Committee to avoid a contempt vote, including offering an under-oath interview with Bill Clinton, but Comer rejected each proposal and demanded an open-ended, transcribed appearance before the full committee.\nA member of the Clintons’ legal team even contacted Comer directly in recent days to resolve the impasse, but Comer did not respond and later said no agreement existed. Comer said he viewed the latest offer in light of what he called the Clintons’ repeated reluctance to testify and questioned whether Bill Clinton intended to answer questions at all. (RELATED: REPORT: Bill Clinton Took Epstein And Maxwell To King’s Wedding)\nThe Clintons continue to downplay their past ties to Epstein, saying they cut off contact with him in 2005, three years before he pleaded guilty to state sex crimes in Florida. Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said Bill Clinton took four flights on Epstein’s jet between 2002 and 2003 but never visited Epstein’s private island or homes, adding that the travel occurred more than two decades ago and ended before Clinton severed ties.\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Bill and Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee‘s investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein ahead of the House moving forward with contempt proceedings, a spokesperson said.\nThe reversal from the Clintons comes after Rep. James Comer (R-KY), the oversight committee chairman, rejected an earlier offer from the couple to testify under limitations, as the House Rules Committee was marking up the legislation to move forward with holding the two in contempt.\n“They negotiated in good faith,” Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña wrote in a post to X. “You did not. They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nComer said in a statement shortly after that the committee needed to clarify the terms under which the Clintons would be testifying before agreeing to hold depositions for them.\n“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions,” Comer said. “The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt. I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”\nThe initial offer was made as the House is set to vote on the resolution to hold the Clintons in contempt of Congress this week, after they failed to show up for their depositions with the committee for its Epstein investigation last month.\n“For the aforementioned reasons, the Committee must decline the unreasonable offer in your January 31, 2026 letter,” Comer wrote in a letter to their attorneys. “It has been nearly six months since your clients first received the Committee’s subpoena, more than three months since the original date of their depositions, and nearly three weeks since they failed to appear for their depositions commensurate with the Committee’s lawful subpoenas. Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency.”\nAccording to the Saturday letter, the offer states the former president would sit for four hours for a voluntary, transcribed interview in New York City, limited to the scope of the Epstein investigation, where lawmakers from both parties and their staff could ask questions. The letter added that both the Clintons and the committee could have their own transcriber.\nThe Clintons’ lawyers pushed for the committee to drop Hillary Clinton’s subpoena, but said that if the committee refused, she could appear for an in-person interview in a format similar to her husband’s.\nComer rejected the terms of the offer, calling them “unreasonable.” He pointed out that in a voluntary, transcribed interview, the witness is allowed to leave questions unanswered, unlike a deposition, and that a time restraint allows the witness to “run out the clock.”\nThe Clintons were set to appear before the oversight committee last month, but they no-showed for their depositions. Comer said he had been in contact with their lawyers for months, trying to work out a date, but the Clintons were not complying.\nWINNER OF SYLVESTER TURNER’S TEXAS SEAT HAS JUST WEEKS BEFORE NEXT ELECTION\nThe Clintons wrote a letter to Comer earlier last month, saying they gave the committee the “little information we have,” as it points to the government’s “failure” in investigating Epstein’s crimes, adding they are prepared to “forcibly defend” themselves.\n“The decisions you have made, and the priorities you have set as chairman regarding the Epstein investigation, have prevented progress in discovering the facts about the government’s role,” the couple wrote."

If such a vote passed, the charges threaten both Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with substantial fines and even jail if they are convicted.\nRep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, said on social media that he would insist on both Clintons sitting for sworn depositions before the committee in order to fulfill the panel’s subpoenas.\nA letter from the committee to the Clintons' attorneys indicates that the committee offered Bill Clinton a 4-hour transcribed interview on “matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein” and that Hillary Clinton would submit a sworn declaration.\nThe Clintons have always denied any illegal activity and have never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Jeffrey Epstein.\nDespite this, Bill Clinton's connections to Epstein have resurfaced as a key Republican talking point during efforts to seek accountability regarding Epstein, who took his own life in 2019 while in a New York detention facility facing sex trafficking allegations.\nClinton, along with numerous other influential figures, maintained a well-documented association with Epstein during the late 1990s and early 2000s - again, with no wrongdoing alleged.\nFollowing subpoenas issued to both Clintons in August by the House Oversight Committee, their legal counsel initially challenged the subpoena's legitimacy. Yet, as Comer warned of potential contempt-of-Congress actions, negotiations toward a settlement began.\nThe Clintons maintained sharp criticism of Comer's approach, accusing him of injecting partisan politics into the probe while neglecting to hold the Trump administration responsible for delays in releasing the Department of Justice's Epstein case documentation.\nThe possibility of such a vote presents an unprecedented scenario: Congress wielding one of its harshest penalties against a former commander-in-chief.\nNo former president has ever been compelled to appear before legislators, though some have chosen to do so willingly.\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries revealed Monday that his caucus would hold deliberations on the contempt resolutions later in the week, and his leadership team would determine whether to whip votes against them.\nSign up to our FREE newsletter and get the top stories to your inbox\nDAILY NEWSLETTER: Sign up here to get the latest news and updates from the Mirror US straight to your inbox with our FREE newsletter."

James Walkinshaw (D-Va.) revealed during a House Rules Committee hearing on Comer’s push to force a vote holding the former president and first lady in contempt of Congress.\nA spokesman for Bill Clinton confirmed the development.\n“They negotiated in good faith.

But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there,” Angel Urena wrote on X.\n“They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone,” he added.\nThe Clintons indicated they would “appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates” and asked that the House scrap a contempt vote expected to take place on Wednesday, according to the New York Times.\nNine Democrats on the oversight panel previously voted with Republicans in support of holding Bill Clinton in contempt, while three Democrats backed holding Hillary Clinton in contempt.\nBoth defied Comer’s subpoena for months, publicly skipping respective deadlines to provide the panel with depositions.\nComer appeared skeptical of the Clintons’ latest offer, and did not immediately move to drop the contempt vote.\n“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions,” Comer said in a statement.\n“The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt,” he added. “I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”\nThe Clintons could serve up to one year, but not less than one month, in jail and be fined between $100 and $1,000 if prosecuted, convicted and sentenced.\nEarlier Monday, Comer had rejected an offer from the couple proposing a “limitation on the scope of President Clinton’s testimony” and a sworn declaration from the ex-secretary of state, in lieu of depositions.\nComer argued the Clintons’ “desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency,” and said having the former president testify for only four hours, as his lawyer requested, would not be enough time.\nThe Clintons’ attorney emailed the new offer while Comer was testifying in the middle of the Rules Committee meeting.\nThe House Rules Committee took a break shortly after it learned of the new letter to give Comer some time to reassess whether a contempt vote was still necessary.\nHouse Rules Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) later announced she would postpone consideration of the contempt measure until at least Tuesday.\nStart your day with all you need to know\nMorning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more.\nThanks for signing up!\nThe rules panel was the final hurdle Comer’s contempt measure needed to clear before heading to the full House for a vote.\nThe Clintons were first issued the subpoenas for testimony by Comer on Aug. 5, 2025, nearly six months ago.\nBill Clinton has admitted having a friendship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s, but he has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\nThe former president reportedly flew on Epstein’s private jet dozens of times, but he denies ever visiting the convicted child sex offender’s notorious private island in the Caribbean."

      "text": "Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reached an agreement with House Republicans on Tuesday to testify later this month in a House investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, averting a potential contempt of Congress vote.\nUnder the agreement, Hillary Clinton is scheduled to testify before the House Oversight Committee on February 26, followed by Bill Clinton on February 27. It will be the first time a former president has been compelled to testify before Congress.\n- Essential Reading: The US Is in Beta as China Changes the Game\n- How Trump’s Nuclear Brinkmanship Is Forcing Iran’s Hand\n- Conventional Wisdom: Trump Kennedy Center Edition\nThe agreement came together Monday evening as Kentucky Representative James Comer, the Republican chair of the committee, was advancing criminal contempt of Congress charges against both Clintons for defying congressional subpoenas issued in August.\n“We look forward to now questioning the Clintons as part of our investigation into the horrific crimes of Epstein and Maxwell, to deliver transparency and accountability for the American people and for survivors,” Comer said in a statement Tuesday.\nWhy It Matters\nThere have been bipartisan calls for more transparency over Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting sex trafficking charges. U.S. lawmakers have released troves of documents pertaining to Epstein and have furthered investigations into the handling of the case.\nLast week, the Republican-led committee approved the contempt resolution against Bill Clinton 34-8, and the vote on Hillary Clinton was 28-15 on Wednesday, after both did not appear for subpoenaed depositions.\nThe Clintons have criticized Comer for seeking their testimony while the Justice Department missed a congressionally mandated deadline to release its full cache of Epstein-related files, saying the demands were politically motivated. But the committee said it was necessary for them to testify.\nIf the contempt resolution goes forward and a former president and former presidential candidate end up in jail, it will be of remarkable historical significance and show the far-reaching consequences of the Epstein case and its ability to permeate in unexpected areas of U.S. politics.\nWhat To Know\nAngel Ureña, a spokesman for the Clintons, indicated on X Monday that the pair \"will be there.\"\nNewsweek viewed a letter from the Clintons' attorneys to Comer confirming their clients would appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.\nComer initially rejected an offer from the Clintons' attorneys to have Bill Clinton conduct a transcribed interview and Hillary Clinton submit a sworn declaration.\nThe committee chair insisted both must sit for sworn depositions to fulfill the subpoenas. A committee letter indicates the Clintons had proposed a four-hour transcribed interview for Bill Clinton on matters related to Epstein investigations and prosecutions, with Hillary Clinton providing a sworn declaration.\nDespite Comer's statement that he had not received written confirmation, Newsweek viewed a letter the Clintons' attorneys sent to Comer stating: \"Please be advised, and please advise the Chairman, that my clients accept the terms of your letter and will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates. As has been the Committee's practice, please confirm the House will not move forward with contempt proceedings, as the Chairman stated in his letter this morning.\"\nBill Clinton's relationship with Epstein has become a focal point for Republicans seeking accountability over the late financier, who killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell while facing sex trafficking charges. Clinton, like several high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s, though he has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with Epstein.\nThe Republican-controlled Oversight panel advanced criminal contempt charges last month, with nine of the committee's 21 Democrats joining Republicans in supporting charges against Bill Clinton, arguing for full transparency. Three Democrats also supported advancing charges against Hillary Clinton.\nWhat People Are Saying\nHouse Oversight Committee on X: \"After defying lawful subpoenas, Bill and Hillary Clinton are trying to dodge contempt by requesting special treatment. The Clintons are not above the law.\"\nAngel Ureña, the Clintons' Spokesman, responding to the Oversight Committee on X: \"They negotiated in good faith. You did not. They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"\nKentucky Republican James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said: \"The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas.\"\nRepresentative Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, on X last week: \"Bill Clinton just refused to show up for his deposition in the Epstein investigation for the second time. We fully support @GOPOversight holding Bill Clinton in contempt. No one is above the law. Not even a former president. Survivors deserve answers. Silence protects predators.\"\nDemocratic Party strategist Donna Brazile, replying to the Clintons' letter on X last week: \"This is how you do it.

      "text": "Bill and Hillary Clinton agree to testify in House about Jeffrey Epstein\nThe agreement, which came as the House was considering holding the couple in contempt, defused a potential showdown between the legislative and executive branches about who could be forced to testify.\nWASHINGTON – Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to give depositions to a House committee about accused late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, defusing a potential showdown between the legislative and executive branches.\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued subpoenas in August 2025 and scheduled appearances for January, but the Clintons defied them at that time.\nBill Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said on social media Feb. 2 that “the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nThe announcement came as the House Rules Committee was considering resolutions to hold the Clintons in criminal contempt. If approved by the House and prosecuted by the Department of Justice, the charges could have potentially led to prison terms for the Clintons.\nThe letter to lawmakers from Clinton lawyers, which USA TODAY has reviewed, said the former president and secretary of state accepted the terms that the Oversight chairman, Rep. James Comer, R-Kentucky, had offered and \"will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.\" The letter also asked the committee to confirm that \"the House will not move forward with contempt proceedings.\"\nComer said he would have to study their proposal because the Clintons had resisted testifying until then. His staff had not received the offer in the minutes before he began testifying about the contempt resolutions. He argued it would set a bad precedent to allow witnesses to avoid testifying until it was apparent that a majority of lawmakers would approve contempt proceedings.\n“We’re going to have to look at this and review this,\" Comer said.\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, welcomed the news but did not say whether the chamber would drop its planned contempt vote.\n“That’s a good development,\" he said. \"We expect everyone to comply with Congress’s subpoenas.”\nThe DOJ is in the midst of releasing millions of pages of documents from its criminal investigations. Despite a new law requiring the release of the documents, millions more pages remain confidential while hundreds of department lawyers scour them to prevent the release of the names of people who accused Epstein of abuse.\nBill Clinton is among the political and business leaders who socialized with Epstein and showed up in the documents. Clinton appeared in pictures and in a handwritten note in a book Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell assembled for Epstein’s 50th birthday.\nBut Clinton hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing. The Clintons have said they have been out of office for more than a decade and had nothing to do with Epstein for more than 20 years.\nComer argued that their testimony remains critical to understanding Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking network and how he curried favor with powerful figures to evade scrutiny.\nCriminal contempt is a misdemeanor carrying a $100,000 fine and up to a year in prison. Steve Bannon, a former Trump political adviser, and Peter Navarro, a Trump trade adviser, were each convicted of contempt for defying subpoenas about the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, and sentenced to four months in prison. Navarro was fined $9,500 and Bannon was fined $6,500.\nBut the DOJ could also decide against prosecution in such cases. The House voted to hold Trump aides from his first term in contempt, including deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, former chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Attorney General Bill Barr and former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. But none were prosecuted.\nIn a scathing letter Jan. 13, Bill and Hillary Clinton had accused Comer of trying to embarrass them, calling the subpoenas \"invalid and legally unenforceable.\"\n\"We are confident that any reasonable person in or out of Congress will see, based on everything we release, that what you are doing is trying to punish those who you see as your enemies and to protect those you think are your friends,\" the Clintons wrote.\nAfter Bill Clinton skipped a hearing on Jan. 13 and Hillary Clinton skipped one on Jan. 14, the committee moved to hold them in contempt.\nBill Clinton's staffer, Urena, said the former president offered on Jan. 30 to meet with Comer and the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, at his New York office. Clinton agreed to answer questions about travel with Epstein, his awareness of criminal activities and efforts by Epstein to gain leverage.\nComer rejected the offer.\n\"The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,\" Comer said on social media.\nThis story was updated to add new information and a new video."

      "text": "Grand houses look settled for decades while a locked vault waits behind oak doors. Keys rarely appear on their own, yet pressure turns them, helped by time.\nEventually, even the most guarded hinges begin to complain.\nSubpoenas Force the Issue\nFormer President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed to sit for sworn depositions before Congress as part of the congressional investigation into Jeffrey Epstein.\nAfter months of resistance through legal channels, House Republicans issued subpoenas for their testimony. The demands focused on personal interactions, travel, and any awareness of Epstein's criminal conduct. At first, attorneys pushed back, but as deadlines closed in, patience ran out.\nComer Raises the Stakes\nEscalating the standoff by preparing a contempt of Congress vote, Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.), Chairman of the House Oversight Committee. Contempt of Congress has teeth, carrying real penalties, including fines and possible jail time.\nComer has been insisting on live, closed-door depositions rather than written responses or transcribed interviews. The committee is looking for accountability through sworn testimony, not curated, lawyer-approved statements.\nAgreement Under Deadline Pressure\nLate on February 1, attorneys representing the Clintons notified committee staff of their willingness to appear. Deputy Chief of Staff to Bill Clinton, Angel Ureña, confirmed their decision publicly, an agreement that ended an immediate contempt vote, though the committee demanded locked-in dates by the end of the day.\nThe Clintons' spokesperson Angel Ureña also issued a response on social media.\n\"They negotiated in good faith. You did not. They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care,\" he wrote.\n\"But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there,\" he added. \"They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.\"\nCompliance replaced confrontation, at least on paper.\nEpstein’s Network and Unanswered Questions\nCultivating relationships across politics, finance, and entertainment, Epstein entertained people for years. Flight logs show Bill Clinton traveled aboard Epstein's plane several times during the early 2000s. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton encountered Epstein at select events during the same period.\nInvestigators want to know who knew what, when awareness formed, and whether warnings were ignored. The inquiry also touches the broader system that allowed Epstein to secure a lenient plea deal in 2008 while victims were kept behind closed doors.\nWhat Testimony Might Bring\nDepositions provided by the Clintons will likely cover travel records, communications, and internal discussions. Closed doors limit public visibility, though transcripts could surface later by committee vote.\nWe can expect careful answers, selective memory, and a lawyerly pace. While nobody expects theatrics, we have to consider a betting line for a ratio of pleading the 5th versus actual answers. Regardless, everybody can expect caution.\nAccountability After Power\nIt's rare for Congress to compel testimony from men who've occupied the Oval Office. Partisans argue motive, yet oversight exists to test power, not protect reputations. The process matters because influence often outlives elections.\nAnswers, even incomplete ones, serve as markers of history and signal whether privilege still outruns persistence.\nEven though the old house still stands, the vault doesn't swing wide. Dust moves, tumblers click, and while some compartments stay sealed, pressure finally leaves fingerprints on the door.\nElite accountability never arrives quickly, and it rarely arrives clean. Persistence forces movement where status once blocked inquiry, even when answers come measured and guarded.

Ford did so to discuss the celebration of the 1987 bicentennial of the enactment of the Constitution.\n* * *\nJust hours after Chair James Comer (R-Ky.) rebuffed Bill and Hillary Clinton's attorney's last-ditch conditional offer, the former president and former secretary of state appear to have acquiesced and agreed to key demands from the Republican-led House Oversight Committee to testify about Jeffrey Epstein in a closed-door deposition.\nThe initial correspondence, obtained by CNN, revealed that the Clintons’ team has been in search of an off-ramp for days.\nAttorneys for Bill and Hillary have been in discussion with the Republican-led committee multiple times since lawmakers from both parties voted in January to hold the Clintons in contempt for refusing to appear for in-person depositions as part of the panel’s investigation into Epstein.\n“It has been nearly six months since your clients first received the Committee’s subpoena, more than three months since the original date of their depositions, and nearly three weeks since they failed to appear for their depositions commensurate with the Committee’s lawful subpoenas,” Comer wrote.\n“Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency.”\nAs CNN reports, according to the letter dated January 31, the Clintons’ lawyers laid out the terms under which the former president would sit for a voluntary, transcribed interview.\nHe would sit for four hours in New York City for an interview limited to the scope of the Epstein probe, they said.\nLawmakers from both parties and their staff could ask questions, and the lawyers said both the Clintons and the committee could have their own transcriber present, according to the letter.\nComer rejected the offer from the Clintons’ attorneys as “unreasonable” and said he could not accept such terms.\nHe could not agree, he said, to changing the interview from a sworn deposition to a voluntary interview, and rejected the way in which the attorneys sought to limit the interview’s scope.\n“But given that he has already failed to appear for a deposition and has refused for several months to provide the Committee with in-person testimony, the Committee cannot simply have faith that President Clinton will not refuse to answer questions at a transcribed interview, resulting in the Committee being right back where it is today,” the Kentucky Republican wrote.\nBy rejecting the Clintons’ initial offer, Comer had all but ensured that the House would hold a final vote this week on the contempt resolutions.\n“Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency,” Mr. Comer wrote in a letter to the Clintons’ lawyers on Monday that was also obtained by The New York Times.\nIndeed, as The NYTimes reports, after some Democrats on the panel joined Republicans in a vote to recommend charging them with criminal contempt, an extraordinary first step in referring them to the Justice Department for prosecution, the Clintons ultimately waved the white flag and agreed to fully comply with Mr. Comer’s demands.\nIn an email sent to Mr. Comer on Monday evening, attorneys for the Clintons said their clients would “appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates” and asked that the House not move forward with a contempt vote, which had been slated for Wednesday.\nHowever, it was not immediately clear Monday evening whether Comer would accept the Clintons' terms and, subsequently, whether the contempt votes would still take place.\nComer said:\n\"The Clintons' counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions. The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt.\"\n\"I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members,\" Comer said in a statement.\nFor Mr. Clinton to testify in the Epstein investigation would be nearly unprecedented.\nNo former president has appeared before Congress since 1983, when President Gerald R. Ford did so to discuss the celebration of the 1987 bicentennial of the enactment of the Constitution.\nWhen Mr. Trump was subpoenaed in 2022 by the select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol, after he had left office, he sued the panel to try to block it. The panel ultimately withdrew the subpoena.\nIt was a victory for the Republican chairman, shifting the focus of his panel’s Epstein investigation onto prominent Democrats who once associated with the disgraced financier and his longtime companion, Ghislaine Maxwell."

      "text": "Lord Mandelson's sick 'incest' joke with Jeffrey Epstein exposed in new emails\nAfter the latest drop of the Epstein files, pressure is building on Lord Mandelson — especially after making a horrific joke about Princess Beatrice to the convicted paedophile\nDisturbing new details of Lord Peter Mandelson's time with Jeffrey Epstein have been exposed in the latest batch of the Epstein files. In one sickening conversation, Lord Mandelson appears to joke about marrying Princess Beatrice, to which Jeffrey brands it \"incest\".\nAnother three million documents are now in the public domain after the US government released the largest wave of information yet on Friday (January 30). People are still combing through the finer details of the documents, with more and more revelations coming to light.\nNow, it has been revealed that Lord Mandelson had had a much deeper relationship with the convicted paedophile than was first thought. Lord Mandelson says he regrets ever knowing Epstein, but has questioned the legitimacy over some of the documents referring to him.\nBut in another discovery, leaked emails between Epstein and Lord Mandelson appear to show the pair joking about getting romantically involved in the royal family, according to the Daily Mail. An email chain dated October 5, 2009, allegedly shows the pair discussing the potential for him to cosy up with the royals.\nIn one email, Epstein suggested that Lord Mandelson \"marry Princess Beatrice\", adding that \"the Queen would have a queen as a grandson\". Lord Mandelson, then an MP, seems to reply: \"Remember, I am already her Lord President,\" to which Epstein fires back: \"Does that make it incest, how exciting.\"\nFurther concerns about Lord Mandelson's relationship with the convicted paedophile were raised after a photo of the pair on a yacht was also found in the latest slew of documents. The exact location of where the pair were has not yet been determined.\nIn a previous statement, Lord Mandelson said he was \"wrong\" to be so close to the disgraced socialite and financier, adding it was not right to continue to be friends with him after his conviction. \"I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered,\" he added.\nComing under increasing pressure from politicians and people alike, Lord Mandelson officially resigned from the Labour Party on Sunday (February 1) after he was named in the latest wave of revelations to come from the Epstein files. This included the now-infamous photo of him stood in his pants chatting to a woman wearing a white dressing gown.\nIt was later confirmed on Monday (February 2) that this photo was taken at an apartment in Paris owned by Epstein, dubbed the \"House of Sin\". This was corroborated through matching the metal balcony of the apartment with the one seen in the photo, according to forensic experts.\nThe Parisienne apartment, however, was also involved in scandal, as Epstein is reported to have raped underage girls within the home. Following his death in 2019, police in France had searched the apartment as part of their investigation into alleged child sex trafficking.\nEventually, the apartment would be sold for just over £8million on the market, after the asking price had to be cut drastically. Lord Mandelson has yet to release another statement following the latest claims.\nFor the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters."

It was not immediately clear when the Clintons are expected to appear before the committee.\nThe Clintons were originally scheduled to be deposed by the committee in mid-December. Committee chair James Comer (R-KY) pushed back the deposition date by a month to accommodate the Clintons’ plans to attend a funeral.\nThe Clintons skipped their scheduled appearance last month. Lawmakers on the committee then voted on a bipartisan basis to forward contempt charges to the House, which was scheduled to take up a vote on the charges this week.\n“Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences,” the Clintons wrote in a letter last month explaining their decision to flout the subpoena. “For us, now is that time.”\nThe Clintons argued in the letter that they had reason to believe the subpoenas to force their testimony were “legally invalid.” They said further that they “tried to give [Comer] the little information [they] have.”\n“We’ve done so because Mr. Epstein’s crimes were horrific,” the letter continued. “There is no plausible explanation for what you are doing other than partisan politics.”\nNeither Bill nor Hillary has been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein. No evidence has been found that Hillary ever traveled with Epstein, much less boarded Epstein’s now-infamous jet, the Lolita Express.\nBill Clinton has admitted to a handful of interactions with Epstein, including four trips on board Epstein’s jet, a meeting at Epstein’s Harlem office in 2002, and “one brief visit to Epstein’s New York apartment.” Reports and court filings have suggested numerous other encounters took place, however.\nThe former president took at least 27 flights on Epstein’s plane, according to a review of flight logs by The Washington Examiner.\nEpstein visited the Clinton White House multiple times throughout the 1990s and attended “a donors’ reception hosted by Bill and Hillary Clinton” in 1993, according to a 2019 report in The Daily Beast. Epstein attended the reception after making a $10,000 donation to the White House Historical Association.\nThe House Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Epstein last year to develop an understanding of the disgraced financier’s “sex trafficking network, the ways Epstein sought to curry favor and influence to evade scrutiny, and how Congress can strengthen laws to better combat human trafficking,” according to the committee.\nEpstein died in 2019 in his jail cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. Since taking over a year ago, the Trump administration has released millions of pages worth of documents, files, communications, and other evidence in the “Epstein files.”"

Hillary Clinton’s spokesperson, Nick Merrill, said in December, “Since this started, we’ve been asking what the hell Hillary Clinton has to do with this, and [Comer] hasn’t been able to come up with an answer.”\nThe Clintons had previously refused to testify, writing in a letter, \"Every person has to decide when they have seen or had enough and are ready to fight for this country, its principles and its people, no matter the consequences. For us, now is that time.\" They later added, \"Despite everything that needs to be done to help our country, you are on the cusp of bringing Congress to a halt to pursue a rarely used process literally designed to result in our imprisonment.

The House was planning on a contempt vote and then a criminal referral to DoJ for the Clintons for not complying with a subpoena on Wednesday.\nORIGINAL STORY:\nBill and Hillary Clinton seem to be hard at work these days shredding their already tattered legacy, and now another ugly charge hangs over their heads. The House of Representatives is set to vote on Wednesday on whether to hold them in contempt of Congress for repeatedly refusing to honor valid congressional subpoenas and testify about their knowledge of the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein saga.\nNow, after nine Democrats joined the Oversight Committee Republicans to forward the Bill Clinton matter to the full House (while three voted the same for Hillary), the Clintons are suddenly making demands.

      "text": "Clintons agree to depositions ahead of contempt of Congress vote\nHouse Oversight chairman says he'll ‘discuss next steps’ with panel members\nBill and Hillary Clinton agreed Monday to appear for depositions as part of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s investigation of deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, as the House took steps to vote on contempt of Congress measures this week.\nAttorneys for the Clintons informed the committee they accept terms outlined in a letter and “will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.” The email from the Clintons’ attorneys asked the House not to move forward with contempt proceedings.\nA spokesman for Bill Clinton, in a social media post, responded to a letter posted by Oversight Chairman James R. Comer, R-Ky., earlier Monday that had rejected an offer from the Clintons’ attorneys.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not. They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care,” Angel Ureña wrote. “But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nThe New York Times first reported the email. The last-minute, behind-the-scenes negotiations unfolded as the House Rules Committee met Monday on an agenda that included rules for floor debate to consider contempt resolutions.\nThe Rules Committee returned from a recess and suspended the discussion on the Clinton measures, but Chairman Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., did not immediately give a reason why. Later, the committee did not provide for floor consideration of the Clinton measures.\nComer, in an emailed statement, said he would take the development back to the Oversight committee members.\n“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions. The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt,” Comer said. “I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”\nA House Oversight subcommittee voted to subpoena the Clintons last summer as part of the panel’s probe into Epstein and his former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a federal prison sentence. Bill Clinton had appeared in photos with Epstein.\nThe Oversight committee has said the Clintons declined deposition dates in mid-December, citing the need to attend a funeral, and then declined to propose a date for January.\nThe Oversight panel advanced contempt measures last month that concluded the Clintons’ “willful refusal to comply” with committee subpoenas “warrants referral to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for prosecution as prescribed by law.”\nEarlier Monday, Comer rejected an offer from attorneys for the Clintons. He posted on social media that the Clintons do not get to “dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas” and the letter from the attorneys made clear the Clintons “still expect special treatment.”\nComer, in a letter posted on social media Monday, rejected the offer from the Clintons’ attorneys and referenced the terms he says the attorneys offered.\nComer, in the letter, said the panel believed that the offer would not lead to former President Clinton answering many questions. He also said the panel could not agree with a four-hour time limit on the former president’s testimony, saying that a time limit gives the witness an incentive to try to run out the clock.\nComer also rejected a request for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to provide a secondary sworn declaration “in lieu of appearing for a deposition,” according to the letter.\n“Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency,” Comer wrote.\nIf the full House adopts contempt measures, the Justice Department would decide whether to pursue criminal charges against the duo, who have long been vilified by President Donald Trump.\nDuring Trump’s second term, the Justice Department has shown a willingness to bring criminal charges against public figures at the direction of the president."

      "text": "OAN Staff Brooke Mallory\n6:22 PM – Monday, February 2, 2026\nUPDATE – 2/3/26 – 10:49 a.m. PT – Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to appear for transcribed and filmed depositions as part of the committee’s ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes and related matters.\nThe agreement, reached on Tuesday, averts a planned contempt of Congress vote.\nHillary Clinton is scheduled to appear on February 26, 2026, with Bill Clinton set for the following day on February 27, 2026.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________\nFebruary 2, 2026 – 6:10 p.m. PT – In a dramatic reversal, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed on Monday to testify before the House Oversight Committee, ending a months-long standoff over their ties to convicted pedophile sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\nHowever, the agreement remains preliminary and not fully finalized. House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) said on Monday that the Clintons’ offer “lacks clarity” and that no specific dates for the depositions have been provided.\nComer has also not yet agreed to drop the pending contempt proceedings, noting that he plans to clarify the terms before discussing next steps with committee members. The contempt vote in the full House could still move forward as early as this week unless further details are resolved.\nThe Clinton legal team had sent an email to the House Oversight Committee earlier on Monday stating they “accept the terms” of the letter and would appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.” This was a significant reversal from their previous stance, where the Clintons had labeled the subpoenas “legally invalid.”\nThe decision also comes just days before the full House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on holding the couple in criminal contempt of Congress. Comer had aggressively pursued the subpoenas, arguing that the Clintons’ previous refusals were an “affront to the American people’s desire for transparency.”\nThe House Oversight Committee Chairman also noted that the “only reason” they are cooperating now is because the threat of criminal contempt became imminent.\nFor months, the Clintons had resisted the committee’s demands, with their legal team labeling the subpoenas both invalid and “politically motivated.” However, as the threat of potential fines or even incarceration loomed with the upcoming contempt vote, the couple’s spokesperson, Angel Ureña, confirmed they would appear.\n“They negotiated in good faith. [Comer] did not,” Ureña wrote in a social media post on Monday. “But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nThe standoff intensified after Chairman Comer rejected the Clintons’ initial “compromise” proposal, which he dismissed as “unreasonable.” Under that offer, the former Democrat president would have sat for a four-hour voluntary, transcribed interview in New York, while Hillary would have provided a sworn written declaration rather than appearing in person.\nNonetheless, Comer blocked the deal, insisting on formal, sworn depositions to ensure the couple cannot “run out the clock” or evade specific lines of questioning as easily as they might in a voluntary setting.\nThe push for testimony saw surprising pockets of bipartisan support. While most Democrats viewed the investigation as a partisan “retribution campaign” linked to the 2026 political cycle, several broke ranks during the initial committee votes. Nine Democrats voted to hold Bill in contempt, and three Democrats voted to hold Hillary in contempt.\n“The nine Democrats who voted in favor of the Bill Clinton resolution are Reps. Maxwell Frost of Florida, Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, Stephen Lynch and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Emily Randall of Washington, Lateefah Simon of California, Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, and Rashida Tlaib of Michican. Lee, Stansbury and Tlaib also voted for the Hillary Clinton resolution,” TIME Magazine reported.\nThese members argued that full transparency regarding the Epstein files outweighs party loyalty.\nThe Oversight Committee is currently probing the federal government’s purported mismanagement of the Epstein case, including his alleged suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019. Bill’s name has appeared in various flight logs and documents related to Epstein, though the former president has consistently denied any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes.\nHillary’s ties to Ghislaine Maxwell — Epstein’s long-time confidante and his convicted “madam” accomplice — span both professional and personal circles.\nMaxwell’s presence at high-profile family events, such as Chelsea Clinton’s 2010 wedding, was mirrored by her inclusion as an honored guest at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2013. This proximity extended to the federal level as well, notably when Maxwell’s nephew, Alexander Djerassi, served as a staffer in the State Department during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State.\nComer has made it clear that a vague promise to appear is insufficient. He is demanding that the Clintons’ legal team provide specific, locked-in dates for the depositions by the end of Monday. Until firm dates are in writing, Comer is treating their agreement as a “delay tactic.”\nStay informed! Receive breaking news alerts directly to your inbox for free.

      "text": "WASHINGTON(AP) — Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed late Monday to testify in a House investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the Republican leading the probe said an agreement had not yet been finalized.\nRep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, continued to press for criminal contempt of Congress charges against both Clintons Monday evening for defying a congressional subpoena when attorneys for the Clintons emailed staff for the Oversight panel, saying the pair would accept Comer's demands and “will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.”\nThe attorneys requested that Comer, a Kentucky Republican, agree not to move forward with the contempt proceedings. Comer, however, said he was not immediately dropping the charges, which would carry the threat of a substantial fine and even incarceration if passed by the House and successfully prosecuted by the Department of Justice.\n“We don't have anything in writing,” Comer told reporters, adding that he was open to accepting the Clintons' offer but “it depends on what they say.”\nThe last-minute negotiating came as Republican leaders were advancing the contempt resolution through the House Rules Committee — a final hurdle before it headed to the House floor for a vote. It was potentially a grave moment for Congress, the first time it could hold a former president in contempt and advance the threat of prison time.\nAs Comer and the Clintons negotiated over the terms of the depositions, the House Rules Committee postponed advancing the contempt of Congress resolutions.\nComer earlier Monday rejected an offer from attorneys for the Clintons to have Bill Clinton conduct a transcribed interview and Hillary Clinton submit a sworn declaration. He insisted that both Clintons sit for sworn depositions before the committee in order to fulfill the panel's subpoenas.\nA letter from the committee to attorneys for the Clintons indicated that they had offered for Bill Clinton to conduct a 4-hour transcribed interview on “matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein” and for Hillary Clinton to submit a sworn declaration.\n“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer said.\nThe former president and secretary of state had resisted the subpoenas for months after the Oversight panel issued subpoenas for their testimony in August as it opened an investigation into Epstein and his associates. Their attorneys had tried to argue against the validity of the subpoena.\nHowever, as Comer threatened to begin contempt of Congress proceedings, the Clintons started negotiating towards a compromise. The Republican-controlled Oversight committee advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges last month. Nine of the committee’s 21 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the charges against Bill Clinton as they argued for full transparency in the Epstein investigation. Three Democrats also supported advancing the charges against Hillary Clinton.\nRepublicans push Bill Clinton's involvement\nBill Clinton’s relationship with Epstein has reemerged as a focal point for Republicans amid the push for a reckoning over Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell as he faced sex trafficking charges.\nClinton, like a bevy of other high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier.\nThe Clintons have remained highly critical of Comer’s decision, saying he was bringing politics into the investigation while failing to hold the Trump administration accountable for delays in producing the Department of Justice’s case files on Epstein.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” a spokesperson for the Clintons, Angel Ureña, said in response to Comer's threats on Monday. “They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care.”\nStill, the prospect of a vote raised the potential for Congress to use one of its most severe punishments against a former president for the first time. Historically, Congress has given deference to former presidents. None has ever been forced to testify before lawmakers, although a few have voluntarily done so.\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said earlier Monday that his caucus would have a discussion on the contempt resolutions later in the week but remained noncommittal on whipping votes against them.\nJeffries said he was a “hard no” on contempt and accused Comer of focusing on political retribution rather than investigating the delayed release of case files. Democrats also say the Justice Department has not yet released all the material it has on the late financier.\n“They don’t want a serious interview, they want a charade,” Jeffries said."

Nine Democrats joined the Republicans to advance the resolution against Bill Clinton, while three voted to advance Hillary Clinton's.\nCLINTON SPOKESMAN LASHES OUT AT COMER OVER EPSTEIN PROBE AS CONTEMPT VOTE NEARS\nThe majority of Democrats, however, have accused Comer of partisan motivations behind his Clinton contempt efforts.\nThe Clintons were two of 10 people subpoenaed by Comer as part of the panel's investigation into Epstein. The subpoenas were issued following a bipartisan vote by an Oversight subcommittee panel during an unrelated hearing on illegal immigration.\nDemocrats on the committee have pointed out that Comer has not pushed to hold others who did not appear in contempt, nor has he made any threats against the DOJ for failing to produce all of its documents on Epstein by a deadline agreed to by Congress late last year. The department has produced a fraction of the documents expected so far.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP\nComer has said he is in contact with the DOJ about its document production.\nIf the vote this week is successful, the House will have recommended both the Clintons for prosecution by the DOJ.\nA contempt of Congress charge is a felony misdemeanor that carries a maximum fine of $100,000 and up to a year in jail."

      "bias": "Lean Left",
      "text": "The Justice Department’s latest release of the Epstein files offers fresh insights into how former President Bill Clinton’s staff communicated with Jeffrey Epstein and his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell, including sometimes-lewd email exchanges.\nThe document dump comes just days before an expected House contempt vote against the Clintons after they rebuffed a subpoena to testify in a bipartisan probe into Epstein.\nThe Republican-led House is expected to vote this week to hold both Bill and Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress for failing to testify. House Oversight Republicans and even some Democrats voted in committee last month to hold the former president and secretary of state in contempt.\nFriday’s release of the Epstein files – more than 3 million documents – follows a smaller, earlier batch in December that revealed never-before-seen photos of Bill Clinton and Epstein together and a shirtless Clinton in a hot tub with someone a DOJ official described as a “victim” of Epstein’s sexual abuse.\nThe latest files include frequent communications between Maxwell — who is currently in prison for sex trafficking — and Clinton staffers between 2001 and 2004. It was during this period that Bill Clinton travelled with his staffers on Epstein’s private plane at least 16 times according to a CNN analysis.\nAlso among the newly released files is a list of sexual abuse accusations against President Donald Trump from unverified tips that the Justice Department compiled last summer. That list also references allegations against Bill Clinton.\nBoth men have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein. Asked for comment on the allegations against Trump in the documents, the White House referred to a Justice Department statement that “this production may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos.”\nA spokesperson for Clinton has repeatedly said the former president cut ties with Epstein before the disgraced financier was charged with soliciting prostitution in 2006 and didn’t know about his crimes. Clinton has also denied ever having visited Epstein’s island.\nClinton and Trump are among numerous high-profile names included in the Epstein files released by the Justice Department. After Trump’s DOJ balked at releasing the files, Congress passed a law last year mandating their disclosure. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in prison awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.\nMaxwell’s emails\nThe names of the Clinton staffers in the emails are often redacted – showing only “WJC” in the email recipient or sender line, which appears to refer to William J. Clinton’s office post-presidency.\nClinton spokesman Angel Ureña told CNN that Bill Clinton did not send any of the emails in the Epstein files.\n“I can’t confirm whose it was, I can only tell you whose it wasn’t: Bill Clinton’s,” Ureña said. “I’d say he has never emailed but in truth he has done so twice in his life, both as President. Once to former astronaut and Senator John Glenn while he was orbiting the Earth aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, and another to the US troops serving in the Adriatic.”\nUreña also said Clinton “neither had nor shared a device or account or address with anyone.”\nMuch of the communications between Maxwell and Clinton’s staff reviewed by CNN pertain to travel and dining logistics, and sometimes last-minute invites to the former president himself. It’s unclear whether the communications were related to the business of the foundation or personal dealings of Clinton or his staff.\nIn one email from April 2003, Maxwell wrote to a redacted Clinton office mail address: “Glad you are coming to the dinner - JE says do you think CLinton would like to come - let me know.”\nIn another email from December 2001, a Clinton staffer asked Maxwell for Prince Andrew’s phone number to coordinate a golf outing during a trip by Bill Clinton to Scotland. Maxwell replied, “Just spoke to Andrew. He is not currently in Scotland but is going to m. He says if I give him a no. he will ring Clinton. Doug, do you want him to call you ?”\nIt’s unclear who “Doug” refers to but a top Clinton adviser at the time was Doug Band. CNN has reached out to Band for comment.\nMaxwell was sometimes flirtatious in her emails to redacted Clinton office email addresses. In one exchange, Maxwell wrote to a Clinton staffer that she told a tabloid what “supper stud you are and how I have a crush on you and how you are hung like a horse and- well you get the picture. Hope you don’t mind!”\nIn another 2002 exchange, a person whose name is redacted wrote to Maxwell from a Clinton email address: “Went home with someone I have before, a 40 year old blonde big boobby widow if you can believe that. I really need to stop drinking.”\nThere’s no evidence in the files that Maxwell personally emailed the former president and vice versa. In one email where the sender name is unredacted, Band said that he and Clinton shared a Blackberry account.\nNearly a decade later, after Maxwell was publicly accused of recruiting and sexually abusing girls with Epstein in 2009, she was still welcome in Clinton circles.\nAs CNN’s KFile previously reported, Maxwell was a guest at the prestigious Clinton Global Initiative conference in September 2013. Maxwell was honored for her now-defunct TerraMar Project, an ocean conservation non-profit she founded in 2012 that did more to restore her reputation than the ocean floors.\nContempt of Congress\nAt the same time that the Justice Department and Epstein’s estate have released documents showing Clinton’s interactions with Epstein, Republicans in the House have clashed with the Clintons’ camp for months over testifying as part of their probe.\nWhile the panel waived in-person appearances for seven others who were subpoenaed as part of its ongoing investigation, House Oversight Chair James Comer insisted that the Clintons appear in person for closed-door interviews.\nThe Republican repeatedly argued that the former president had specific information relevant to the investigation because Epstein visited the White House and Bill Clinton flew on his private plane.\nAttorneys representing the Clintons repeatedly asserted in letters that they were being unfairly singled out and called the panel’s subpoenas for their testimony “invalid and legally unenforceable.”\nThe Clintons’ counsel sought a last-minute off-ramp and offered to make the former president available for an interview with Comer, Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the panel and some staff in New York “on areas within the scope” of the panel’s Epstein probe.\nComer rejected the offer, however, and asserted that the Clintons were trying to get special treatment. When negotiations fell apart, neither Clinton appeared for their scheduled in-person depositions.\nWhen the committee moved to hold the Clintons in contempt, it wasn’t just Republicans who backed it: Nearly half of the Democrats on the committee also voted to advance the contempt to the House floor, arguing that their votes were intended to protect the power of a congressional subpoena.\nThe committee vote rankled top Democrats, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who argued that the Clintons were still negotiating with Congress and suggested no proceedings should move forward against the Clintons until after the Justice Department has released all of the Epstein investigative files.\nA successful contempt vote by the GOP-controlled House would be symbolic — as a rebuke to the Clintons — but also could be used as a tool to compel them to testify. It could have legal consequences, too, as the matter would be referred to the Justice Department for potential prosecution if the House approves it.\nThere’s still the possibility for a deal before the House votes. Last week, Comer suggested to reporters “there is an opportunity” for the two sides to reach an agreement."

Mark Pocan, D-Wis., chairman emeritus of the Progressive Caucus, agreed with his colleagues.\n“This will make Donald Trump happy in the short term, but in the long term, a year from now, we have subpoena power,” he said, warning: “What goes around comes around.”"

      "text": "Donald Trump Shockingly Defends Ex-President Bill Clinton Amid Epstein Scandal: 'He Understood Me'\nFeb. 5 2026, Published 7:14 a.m. ET\nDonald Trump is coming to the defense of former President Bill Clinton as renewed scrutiny swirls around the Epstein files.\nDuring an NBC interview that aired on Wednesday, February 4, Trump admitted he feels uneasy about the attention Clinton is currently facing. The conversation turned to Bill and Hillary Clinton after reporter Tom Llamas asked about calls for the couple to testify before Congress, with Democrats pushing for both to appear.\nDonald said it was a “shame” that the Clintons are being forced into the spotlight. He also pushed back on comparisons to his own legal battles, noting that he has already been targeted repeatedly.\n“They’ve already brought me…they had me indicted many, many times…they didn’t do that to Clinton,” Donald said.\n“It bothers me that somebody’s going after Bill Clinton,” Donald said. “I liked his behavior toward me. I thought he got me, he understood me.\"\nDonald then pointed to a moment from the 2016 election cycle that stuck with him.\n“You know, he was the one that said very famously that you don’t want to run against Donald when there were 18 people,” he said, referring to the crowded GOP primary.\nHe also claimed, “Hillary sort of laughed at him.”\nMeanwhile, Bill did not comply with a subpoena requiring him to give a deposition in the Epstein investigation on January 13. House GOP leaders then scheduled a February 4 vote on two contempt of Congress resolutions targeting both Bill and Hillary.\n- 'It's a Terrible Thing': Donald Trump Says He Doesn't 'Like' the Pictures of 'Nice' Bill Clinton With Dead Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein From Latest File Dump\n- Donald Trump Orders FBI to 'Investigate' Bill Clinton's 'Relationship' With Jeffrey Epstein Amid Email 'Hoax': 'Stay Tuned!'\n- Donald Trump Insists He 'Never Went' to Notorious Epstein Island But Admits It's 'Nice'\nWant OK! each day? Sign up here!\nAfter facing the threat of contempt charges, the Clintons agreed to participate in voluntary, on-camera depositions. Hillary is set to testify on February 26, followed by Bill on February 27.\nAs OK! previously reported, dozens of newly surfaced photos tied to the Epstein investigation allegedly show Jeffrey Epstein and Bill in compromising situations.\nThe latest release, made public on January 30, included images of Bill, 79, traveling alongside Jeffrey to destinations such as Morocco, St. Tropez and more.\nOne set of photos labeled “Morocco King Wedding” shows the former president wearing a red shirt while tasting cake. Other materials included redacted images of women in bikinis, as well as photos labeled “nudes.” In several images, Jeffrey appeared holding women or standing nearby in the background.\nThe Department of Justice has released more than three million pages of documents connected to Jeffrey, referencing high-profile figures including Donald, Elon Musk and Bill Gates.\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche later revealed that six million pages exist in total. However, he explained that not all materials could be released due to child sexual abuse material and obligations to protect victims’ rights.\nTodd also rejected claims that the DOJ was shielding Donald, 79, who was once known to have been friendly with Jeffrey, after the scheduled December 2025 release was delayed.\n“We did not protect President Trump,” Todd said during a press conference on January 30. “We didn’t protect or not protect anybody.”"

      "text": "Donald Trump and the Clintons are no strangers to each other. Outside the shared presidential sphere of influence and history, they’ve been associated with many of the same people, past and present. It just so happens one very infamous “friend” they shared, Jeffrey Epstein, will go down in history as the most well-known pedophile of all time, and the only thing more controversial than his deeds are the names and associates of everybody who visited his little island of horrors. The Clintons will face a deposition in Washington, D.C., about their Epstein connections, and in a bizarre move being mocked by the internet, Donald Trump feels sorry for them.\nIn a viral Reddit post, following a story reported by The Hill, President Trump had some odd and choice words for his political rivals.\nI think it’s a shame to be honest. I always liked him. Her? Yeah. She’s a very capable woman who’s better at debating than some of the other people, I’ll tell you that. She was smarter, smart woman. I hate to see it in many ways, But then I look at me. They went after me. They wanted me to go to jail for the rest of my life and it turned out I was innocent. I shouldn’t feel this way but I feel badly that they have to go through that.\nAs you can see, this is very different from the rhetoric he used when he ran against Hillary in the 2016 election, and many are pointing out that the sympathy likely stems from fear that he may be next as the Epstein investigation continues to ramp up. This led many folks on Reddit to lambast Trump and the Clintons alike, and many wonder if the newfound sympathy Trump has on display is due to fear of his own future.\n“Oh, lots, pretty much every time I was on the Island, I was really just there for Donny. I mean, you see how he dances with his hands? He learned that with me” – Bill Clinton under oath.”\n“I’m guessing that Clinton has receipts, and if he’s going down, then he’ll take everyone else down with him.”\n“Say what you will about them, but the Clintons, particularly President Clinton, are masters at political jiu-jitsu and have 35+ years of experience on turning the tables in these partisan hearings. I can’t believe the Republicans actually think giving Bill Clinton a microphone is a good idea.”\nAs you can see, many are curious about why they even make the move, or are downright celebrating the shared history and madness on display in the Epstein drama. We will learn more as the looming Washington, D.C., depositions approach."

The lawyers are looking into the details.”\nJohnson also welcomed the decision earlier, describing it as a positive step toward cooperation with congressional oversight.\nLast week, the House Oversight Committee recommended that Bill and Hillary Clinton be cited for contempt, accusing them of refusing to testify in person about their interactions with Epstein.\nWhile the Clintons had indicated a willingness to cooperate with the investigation, they had initially declined to appear physically before the committee.\nThey argued that the inquiry was politically motivated and designed to shield Republican President Donald Trump.\nResponding to the criticism, the Clintons’ deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, defended their position in a social media post.\n“They told you under oath what they know, but you don't care.

James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, continued to press for criminal contempt of Congress charges against both Clintons Monday evening for defying a congressional subpoena when attorneys for the Clintons emailed staff for the Oversight panel, saying the pair would accept Comer’s demands and “will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.”\n“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer said.\nREAD: Epstein files name filmmaker Mira Nair, NYC Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s mother (\nThe investigation itself seeks to examine Epstein’s political and social connections and determine whether any public officials had knowledge of or involvement in his criminal activities, though no allegations of wrongdoing have been formally made against either Clinton.\nThe former president and secretary of state had resisted the subpoenas for months after the Oversight panel issued subpoenas for their testimony in August as it opened an investigation into Epstein and his associates, as their attorneys tried to argue against the validity of the subpoena.\nTaken together, the unfolding situation places the Clintons at a politically sensitive crossroads, where long-standing questions about transparency, accountability, and public trust intersect with renewed congressional scrutiny.\nEven without formal allegations, the prospect of sworn testimony ensures that their past associations will once again be examined in a public forum, reinforcing how Epstein’s legacy continues to reverberate through American political life years after his death.\nFor the Clintons, the stakes seem to be less about immediate legal exposure and more about perception and precedent. Agreeing to testify may be viewed as an effort to draw a line under lingering speculation and demonstrate cooperation with congressional oversight.\nREAD: Epstein files: The empire of willful blindness (\nAt the same time, the surrounding uncertainty, including unresolved procedural disputes and the ongoing threat of contempt underscores how contentious and politically charged the process has become.\nThe episode also reflects a broader shift in how high-profile political figures are treated by congressional investigations. Former presidents and cabinet officials are no longer insulated from aggressive oversight tactics, particularly in an era of heightened polarization and partisan investigations.\nThis reality carries reputational risks regardless of the outcome, as even cooperation can prolong public attention on controversial associations.\nWhat this means for the Clintons will depend not only on what emerges from testimony, but on how decisively the process is resolved. A clear conclusion could help quiet speculation, while prolonged conflict may extend scrutiny indefinitely.\nEither way, the situation illustrates how unresolved questions from the past can continue to shape political narratives long after formal power has been relinquished."

      "text": "(WASHINGTON) — House Oversight Chairman James Comer has set a noon deadline Tuesday for Bill and Hillary Clinton to agree to the GOP’s specific terms for depositions that the Clintons signaled Monday night they generally would comply with, warning that if they do not then Republicans will reconvene to move contempt resolutions toward a full House vote.\n“The Oversight Committee is seeking clarification the Clintons accepted the standard deposition terms that they were subpoenaed for: transcribed, filmed depositions in February with no time limit pursuant to the committee’s investigation. The depositions are pursuant to the Committee’s investigative purpose as laid out across its letters and contempt reports,” a person familiar with the matter told ABC News.\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, in a news conference Tuesday alongside House GOP leadership, said Comer was “in the middle of a negotiation with the Clintons.”\n“They have until noon today to fully comply, otherwise we will move contempt tomorrow against the Clintons,” Scalise reiterated.\nFormer President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed on Monday evening to sit for closed-door depositions in the committee’s Jeffrey Epstein investigation.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” Clinton spokesperson Angel Ureña posted on X. “They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nLast month, the House Oversight Committee voted to advance two bipartisan resolutions holding the Clintons in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with its subpoenas relating to convicted sex offender Epstein.\nFor months, the Clintons had insisted that the subpoenas were without legal merit. Comer, a Republican, has pushed back, saying the Clintons are not above the law and must comply with a subpoena.\nBesides defying the subpoenas to testify before the House committee, neither Bill Clinton nor Hillary Clinton has been accused of wrongdoing and both deny having any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes. No Epstein survivor or associate has ever made a public allegation of wrongdoing or inappropriate behavior by the former president or his wife in connection with his prior relationship with Epstein.\nIn a letter dated Jan. 31, the Clintons’ legal teams wrote the committee to lay out the parameters of a prospective interview — alongside a request for the committee to withdraw its subpoena and contempt resolution — proposing a four-hour transcribed interview in lieu of a deposition conducted under oath.\nThe letter states the interview should occur in New York City — open to all committee members — while the scope of questions would be “confined to matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein.” The president also asked to designate his own transcriber, alongside a court reporter employed by the House.\n“This framework is consistent with your priorities as communicated by Committee staff and as identified during the business meeting on January 21st,” the letter, signed by Clinton attorneys Katherine Turner and Ashley Callen, stated. “Pursuant to your request for this comprehensive written proposal, we ask that you respond in kind should there remain any specific area of disagreement to continue this good-faith effort to avoid legal proceedings that will prevent our clients from providing testimony in addition to the sworn statements they already submitted.”\nComer wrote back Monday, citing “serious concerns with the offer,” beginning with the proposed scope restriction — predicting President Clinton “would refuse to answer questions” related to his personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.\nComer also balked at the proposed four-hour time limit for the interview, and the president’s bid to break blocks of questioning into 30-minute periods — rather than 60-minute periods — that alternate between Republicans and Democrats.\n“A hard time-limit provides a witness with the incentive to attempt to run out the clock by giving unnecessarily long answers and meandering off-topic. This is a particular concern where a witness, such as President Clinton, has an established record of being a loquacious individual,” Comer said.\n“Limiting President Clinton’s testimony to four hours is insufficient time for the Committee to gain a full understanding of President Clinton’s personal relationship with them, his knowledge of their sex-trafficking ring, and his experience with their efforts to curry favor and exercise influence to protect themselves,” he added of President Clinton’s relationship with Epstein and Maxwell.\nFinally, Comer took umbrage with the proposition for a transcribed interview, not a sworn deposition.\n“A transcribed interview is voluntary, meaning that the subject may refuse to answer questions absent any assertion of privilege or constitutional right,” Comer noted. “The conditions requested thus would enable President Clinton to refuse to answer whatever questions he wanted for whatever reasons he wanted and leave as the Committee’s only recourse to again subpoena President Clinton’s testimony, effectively restarting this entire process from the beginning.”\nAs for Hillary Clinton, the lawyers’ letter echoes her sworn declaration, stating she “never held an office with responsibility for, or involvement with, DOJ’s handling of these investigations or prosecutions,” adding “the same is true as a private citizen after leaving office in 2013.”\nThe lawyers also requested that Comer withdraw the subpoena and resolution of contempt “so that we may continue to work in good faith toward an agreement that meets the Committee’s needs while accounting for the limited information Secretary Clinton can provide.”\nIn response, Comer emphasized “the necessity” of Hillary Clinton’s in-person testimony juxtaposed against the “unacceptability of simple sworn declarations.”\nComer concluded that the Clintons’ “desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency.”\nCopyright © 2026, ABC Audio.

      "text": "Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify in the Republican-led House Oversight Committee’s probe into Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking network, dodging a looming contempt of Congress vote just in time. This surprising U-turn came on Monday, 2 February, 2026, after months of subpoenas, sworn declarations, and rising threats from Chair James Comer.\nThe committee subpoenaed the Clintons last August alongside ex-AGs like Loretta Lynch and FBI directors, seeking insights on Epstein. They submitted affidavits claiming no relevant information, but skipped in-person depositions, calling probes politically motivated to save Trump. Comer blasted their New York office offer as “unreasonable” and advanced contempt resolutions, 34-8 for Bill and 28-15 for Hillary.\nHouse Rules prepped a floor vote this week, but Clinton spokesperson Angel Ureña announced compliance via a post on X, “They negotiated in good faith. You did not. They testified under oath about what they know, but that seems irrelevant to you. Nevertheless, the former President and former Secretary of State will attend. They look forward to establishing a precedent that should be applicable to all.”\nThey negotiated in good faith. You did not.\n— Angel Ureña (@angelurena) February 2, 2026\nThey told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care.\nBut the former President and former Secretary of State will be there.\nThey look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone. https://t.co/iO67XjNFsT\nComer said he is “reconsidering” contempt after the Clintons pledged closed-door depositions. A bipartisan subpoena existed, but Democrats aided Republicans on the US Department of Justice probes. The Clintons vowed to fight if pushed, “In every individual’s life, there comes a moment when they must determine if they have had enough… For us, that moment is now.”\nJeffrey Epstein’s 2019 jailhouse death was ruled a suicide amid broken cameras and guard lapses. This left several unanswered questions about his elite network of politicians, celebrities, and royals (the big names of the world!), accused of child sex trafficking. Flight logs show Bill Clinton on the “Lolita Express” 26 times, per released documents, though he denies any island visits or wrongdoings. Hillary’s mentions tie to political angles. Donald Trump, a past Epstein pal, banned him from Mar-a-Lago but faces scrutiny over Alexander Acosta’s 2008 controversial plea deal.\nThe overall drama underscores polarized Washington, Epstein’s dirty tentacles touch all sides, yet truth slips away, and justice for Epstein Island victims in Comer’s own term is, “…continue to delay, delay, delay.”\nRelated: To Ease Financial Pressure After US Banks Retreat Funding, Oracle Eyes 30,000 Layoffs!"

      "text": "It took a few tries, but it looks like former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, will finally have to answer some questions about their purported ties to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe former first couple came under intense scrutiny in January, when Bill and Hillary requested — and received — rescheduled closed-door hearings pertaining to Epstein due to scheduling conflicts.\n(The former president and the unsuccessful 2016 Democratic presidential candidate had been subpoenaed by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to testify about their relationships with sex traffickers Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.)\nThe issue, however, was that when the time rolled around for the new dates, neither Bill nor Hillary were anywhere to be found.\nThat ultimately led to both Clintons being held in contempt of Congress after a fiery bipartisan Oversight Committee vote.\n“No witness — not a former president or a private citizen — may willfully defy a duly issued congressional subpoena without consequence,” House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer said.\nHouse Oversight Chair James Comer drops a SCORCHING opening statement before the vote to hold the Clintons in contempt for ignoring subpoenas.\n— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) January 21, 2026\nHe displayed damning posters showing Bill Clinton in a hot tub with and getting massages from Epstein victims.\n“Subpoenas are not mere… pic.twitter.com/VUJ6J9N40g\nBoth Bill and Hillary would be present at these closed-door hearings, according to the former president’s Deputy Chief of Staff Angel Urena.\n“They negotiated in good faith,” Urena posted in a direct response to the Oversight Committee. “You did not.”\n“They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care,” he added. “But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nFox News had reportedly seen the text of the email that the Clintons’ legal team sent, confirming that both would appear for their depositions.\nAnd according to the text acquired by Fox News, it appears that the threat of contempt seemed to do its trick.\nOrder Troy Anderson’s New Book, “Designated Disrupter” on Amazon.com!\n“Please be advised, and please advise the Chairman, that my clients accept the terms of your letter and will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates,” the text read, per Fox News. “As has been the Committee’s practice, please confirm the House will not move forward with contempt proceedings, as the Chairman stated in his letter this morning.”\nOf note, this saga appears to have come to a close nearly a full month and a half after Urena sent a rather defiant message regarding the status of the Epstein files, and Bill’s relationship with the disgraced mogul.\n“The Epstein Files Transparency Act imposes a clear legal duty on the U.S. Department of Justice to produce the full and complete record the public demands and deserves,” Urena wrote. “However, what the Department of Justice has released so far, and the manner in which it did so, makes on thing clear: someone or something is being protected.\n“We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this: We need no such protection.”\nThis article originally appeared on The Western Journal and is reposted with permission."

      "text": "🔴 Website 👉 https://u-s-news.com/\nTelegram 👉 https://t.me/usnewscom_channel\nOAN Staff Brooke Mallory\n6:22 PM – Monday, February 2, 2026\nIn a dramatic reversal, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed on Monday to testify before the House Oversight Committee, ending a months-long standoff over their ties to convicted pedophile sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\nHowever, the agreement remains preliminary and not fully finalized. House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.) said on Monday that the Clintons’ offer “lacks clarity” and that no specific dates for the depositions have been provided.\nComer has also not yet agreed to drop the pending contempt proceedings, noting that he plans to clarify the terms before discussing next steps with committee members. The contempt vote in the full House could still move forward as early as this week unless further details are resolved.\nThe Clinton legal team had sent an email to the House Oversight Committee earlier on Monday stating they “accept the terms” of the letter and would appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.” This was a significant reversal from their previous stance, where the Clintons had labeled the subpoenas “legally invalid.”\nThe decision also comes just days before the full House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on holding the couple in criminal contempt of Congress. Comer had aggressively pursued the subpoenas, arguing that the Clintons’ previous refusals were an “affront to the American people’s desire for transparency.”\nThe House Oversight Committee Chairman also noted that the “only reason” they are cooperating now is because the threat of criminal contempt became imminent.\nFor months, the Clintons had resisted the committee’s demands, with their legal team labeling the subpoenas both invalid and “politically motivated.” However, as the threat of potential fines or even incarceration loomed with the upcoming contempt vote, the couple’s spokesperson, Angel Ureña, confirmed they would appear.\n“They negotiated in good faith. [Comer] did not,” Ureña wrote in a social media post on Monday. “But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nThe standoff intensified after Chairman Comer rejected the Clintons’ initial “compromise” proposal, which he dismissed as “unreasonable.” Under that offer, the former Democrat president would have sat for a four-hour voluntary, transcribed interview in New York, while Hillary would have provided a sworn written declaration rather than appearing in person.\nNonetheless, Comer blocked the deal, insisting on formal, sworn depositions to ensure the couple cannot “run out the clock” or evade specific lines of questioning as easily as they might in a voluntary setting.\nThe push for testimony saw surprising pockets of bipartisan support. While most Democrats viewed the investigation as a partisan “retribution campaign” linked to the 2026 political cycle, several broke ranks during the initial committee votes. Nine Democrats voted to hold Bill in contempt, and three Democrats voted to hold Hillary in contempt.\n“The nine Democrats who voted in favor of the Bill Clinton resolution are Reps. Maxwell Frost of Florida, Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, Stephen Lynch and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Emily Randall of Washington, Lateefah Simon of California, Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, and Rashida Tlaib of Michican. Lee, Stansbury and Tlaib also voted for the Hillary Clinton resolution,” TIME Magazine reported.\nThese members argued that full transparency regarding the Epstein files outweighs party loyalty.\nThe Oversight Committee is currently probing the federal government’s purported mismanagement of the Epstein case, including his alleged suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019. Bill’s name has appeared in various flight logs and documents related to Epstein, though the former president has consistently denied any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes.\nHillary’s ties to Ghislaine Maxwell — Epstein’s long-time confidante and his convicted “madam” accomplice — span both professional and personal circles.\nMaxwell’s presence at high-profile family events, such as Chelsea Clinton’s 2010 wedding, was mirrored by her inclusion as an honored guest at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2013. This proximity extended to the federal level as well, notably when Maxwell’s nephew, Alexander Djerassi, served as a staffer in the State Department during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State.\nComer has made it clear that a vague promise to appear is insufficient. He is demanding that the Clintons’ legal team provide specific, locked-in dates for the depositions by the end of Monday. Until firm dates are in writing, Comer is treating their agreement as a “delay tactic.”\nStay informed! Receive breaking news alerts directly to your inbox for free.

      "text": "WASHINGTON — Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed late Monday to testify in a House investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, but the Republican leading the probe said an agreement had not yet been finalized.\nRep. James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, continued to press for criminal contempt of Congress charges against both Clintons Monday evening for defying a congressional subpoena when attorneys for the Clintons emailed staff for the Oversight panel, saying the pair would accept Comer’s demands and “will appear for depositions on mutually agreeable dates.”\nThe attorneys requested that Comer, a Kentucky Republican, agree not to move forward with the contempt proceedings. Comer, however, said he was not immediately dropping the charges, which would carry the threat of a substantial fine and even incarceration if passed by the House and successfully prosecuted by the Department of Justice.\n“We don’t have anything in writing,” Comer told reporters, adding that he was open to accepting the Clintons’ offer but “it depends on what they say.”\nThe last-minute negotiating came as Republican leaders were advancing the contempt resolution through the House Rules Committee — a final hurdle before it headed to the House floor for a vote. It was potentially a grave moment for Congress, the first time it could hold a former president in contempt and advance the threat of prison time.\nAs Comer and the Clintons negotiated over the terms of the depositions, the House Rules Committee postponed advancing the contempt of Congress resolutions.\nComer earlier Monday rejected an offer from attorneys for the Clintons to have Bill Clinton conduct a transcribed interview and Hillary Clinton submit a sworn declaration. He insisted that both Clintons sit for sworn depositions before the committee in order to fulfill the panel’s subpoenas.\nA letter from the committee to attorneys for the Clintons indicated that they had offered for Bill Clinton to conduct a 4-hour transcribed interview on “matters related to the investigations and prosecutions of Jeffrey Epstein” and for Hillary Clinton to submit a sworn declaration.\n“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” Comer said.\nThe former president and secretary of state had resisted the subpoenas for months after the Oversight panel issued subpoenas for their testimony in August as it opened an investigation into Epstein and his associates. Their attorneys had tried to argue against the validity of the subpoena.\nHowever, as Comer threatened to begin contempt of Congress proceedings, the Clintons started negotiating towards a compromise. The Republican-controlled Oversight committee advanced criminal contempt of Congress charges last month. Nine of the committee’s 21 Democrats joined Republicans in support of the charges against Bill Clinton as they argued for full transparency in the Epstein investigation. Three Democrats also supported advancing the charges against Hillary Clinton.\nRepublicans push Bill Clinton’s involvement\nBill Clinton’s relationship with Epstein has reemerged as a focal point for Republicans amid the push for a reckoning over Epstein, who killed himself in 2019 in a New York jail cell as he faced sex trafficking charges.\nClinton, like a bevy of other high-powered men, had a well-documented relationship with Epstein in the late 1990s and early 2000s. He has not been accused of wrongdoing in his interactions with the late financier.\nThe Clintons have remained highly critical of Comer’s decision, saying he was bringing politics into the investigation while failing to hold the Trump administration accountable for delays in producing the Department of Justice’s case files on Epstein.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” a spokesperson for the Clintons, Angel Ureña, said in response to Comer’s threats on Monday. “They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care.”\nStill, the prospect of a vote raised the potential for Congress to use one of its most severe punishments against a former president for the first time. Historically, Congress has given deference to former presidents. None has ever been forced to testify before lawmakers, although a few have voluntarily done so.\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said earlier Monday that his caucus would have a discussion on the contempt resolutions later in the week but remained noncommittal on whipping votes against them.\nJeffries said he was a “hard no” on contempt and accused Comer of focusing on political retribution rather than investigating the delayed release of case files. Democrats also say the Justice Department has not yet released all the material it has on the late financier.\n“They don’t want a serious interview, they want a charade,” Jeffries said."

      "text": "WASHINGTON — In a dramatic reversal that averted a historic constitutional showdown, former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton agreed on Monday to testify before the House Oversight Committee. The decision comes after months of legal maneuvering and just hours before the House of Representatives was scheduled to vote on whether to hold the couple in criminal contempt of Congress.\nThe agreement marks a significant turning point in the committee’s sprawling investigation into the federal government’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case and his expansive sex-trafficking network. For months, the Clintons had dismissed the subpoenas as “legally invalid” and “politically motivated,” but the looming threat of criminal prosecution appears to have forced their hand.\nA High-Stakes Game of Brinkmanship\nThe tension reached a fever pitch on Monday afternoon as the House Rules Committee moved to advance contempt resolutions against the former first couple. Had the full House voted to approve the charges, the matter would have been referred to the Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecution—a move that carried the threat of heavy fines and even prison time.\n“The Clintons do not get to dictate the terms of lawful subpoenas,” said Representative James Comer (R-Ky.), Chairman of the House Oversight Committee. “While they attempted to offer limited, non-sworn statements, this committee has remained firm: we require sworn depositions to ensure full transparency for the American people.”\nEarlier in the day, attorneys for the Clintons proposed a compromise under which the former president would sit for a four-hour “transcribed interview” and the former Secretary of State would submit a written declaration. Chairman Comer rejected the offer, characterizing it as an attempt to “run out the clock” and evade the rigors of a formal deposition where witnesses are legally bound to answer questions or explicitly invoke constitutional privileges.\nThe Statement from the Clinton Camp\nShortly after the House committee indicated it would proceed with the contempt vote regardless of the compromise offer, a Clinton spokesperson, Angel Ureña, confirmed the change in stance.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not,” Ureña stated in a post on social media directed at Chairman Comer. “They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care. But the former president and former secretary of state will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone.”\nWhile the Clinton team maintains that they have already provided the committee with the “limited information” they possess, the agreement to appear for formal depositions suggests a shift in legal strategy. The committee is particularly interested in Bill Clinton’s documented travel on Epstein’s private aircraft and both Clintons’ social interactions with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell during the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nBipartisan Pressure and the Epstein Files\nThe push for testimony hasn’t been entirely partisan. In a rare display of cross-aisle cooperation on the Oversight Committee, several Democrats joined Republicans in voting to advance the contempt charges last month. These lawmakers argued that the gravity of the Epstein investigation—and the need to understand how he evaded justice for decades—superseded political loyalties.\nThe investigation has gained fresh momentum following the release of a massive cache of Department of Justice files related to Epstein in late 2025. These documents included previously unseen photographs and flight logs that reinvigorated public interest in Epstein’s high-profile associates.\nWhat Happens Next?\nWhile the Clintons have agreed in principle to testify, the exact dates and locations for the depositions are still being finalized. Chairman Comer noted that the committee needs “clarity” on the terms to ensure the depositions are not restricted by the arbitrary time limits previously proposed by the Clintons’ legal team.\nThe depositions are expected to take place in late February or early March. Legal experts suggest the sessions will likely be held behind closed doors, though a redacted transcript may be released to the public later.\nAs the 119th Congress continues its investigation, the testimony of a former president and a former secretary of state will undoubtedly be the most high-profile moment of the probe. For survivors of Epstein’s abuse and for the public seeking answers, the hope is that this compliance leads to a clearer picture of how a convicted sex offender maintained such proximity to the highest levels of power.\nSources and Links\n- The Guardian: Bill and Hillary Clinton agree to testify in House Epstein investigation\n- Associated Press (AP): Clintons agree to testify in House Epstein investigation ahead of contempt of Congress vote\n- Fox News: Clintons agree to testify after House threatens contempt in Jeffrey Epstein probe\n- PBS NewsHour: Clintons try to reach agreement for Epstein testimony with contempt of Congress vote looming\n- Washington Examiner: Bill and Hillary Clinton cave to Oversight Committee and agree to testify in Epstein probe\n- House Oversight Committee (Official): Chairman Comer: Bill and Hillary Clinton Are Not Above the Law\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in South Florida Reporter is for general information purposes only.\nThe South Florida Reporter assumes no responsibility for errors or omissions in the contents of the Service.\nIn no event shall the South Florida Reporter be liable for any special, direct, indirect, consequential, or incidental damages or any damages whatsoever, whether in an action of contract, negligence or other tort, arising out of or in connection with the use of the Service or the contents of the Service.\nThe Company reserves the right to make additions, deletions, or modifications to the contents of the Service at any time without prior notice.\nThe Company does not warrant that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components"

Comer said the committee is still reviewing the agreement to ensure clarity and compliance.\nThe investigation intensified following the release of millions of pages of Epstein-related documents by the Department of Justice in early 2026, prompting renewed scrutiny of individuals linked to the late financier and convicted sex offender.\nIf the depositions move forward, the testimony would represent one of the rare instances in U.S. history in which a former president appears before a congressional committee as part of an active investigation.\nBill Clinton has previously acknowledged traveling aboard Epstein’s private jet in connection with work for his charitable foundation but has repeatedly denied any involvement in Epstein’s criminal activities or any visits to Epstein’s private island. Hillary Clinton has stated that she had no meaningful personal interactions with Epstein.\nThe House Oversight Committee has not yet announced a timeline for concluding the investigation, but officials say additional witnesses may be called as document reviews continue."

      "text": "Former US President Bill Clinton has agreed to testify before a congressional investigation into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has also agreed. Their decision comes just days before a scheduled vote. The vote is on whether to hold the couple in criminal contempt. This is regarding a prior refusal to appear before the House Oversight Committee. This comes after a months-long standoff.\nBill Clinton was acquainted with Epstein. He has denied any knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activities. Clinton claims to have cut off contact two decades ago. The timing of the depositions remains unclear. However, this marks the first time a former U.S. president has testified before a congressional panel since 1983.\nThe House Oversight Committee, led by Republicans and supported by several Democrats, recently approved the contempt measure. On Monday, Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Ureña, confirmed the couple’s upcoming appearance. He stated they had negotiated in good faith. They had also previously provided sworn statements to the committee. The Clintons maintain they have already supplied all relevant information on Epstein and dismissed the legal summonses as politically motivated.\nBill Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing by Epstein’s survivors. Flight logs show he took four international flights on Epstein’s private jet in 2002 and 2003. Recently released Justice Department records include photos of Clinton at Epstein’s estate. His spokesperson says these photos are decades old. They predate any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes.\nIn a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, the Clintons criticised the handling of the investigation. They suggested it was driven by partisan politics. Comer, however, insists the subpoenas were approved in a bipartisan vote. He states that “no-one is above the law.” Comer accuses the Clintons of repeated delays."

      "text": "We show you our most important and recent visitors news details Clintons agree to testify in Epstein probe ahead of House contempt vote in the following article\nHind Al Soulia - Riyadh - WASHINGTON — Former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have agreed to testify in a congressional investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in the hopes of avoiding a looming contempt vote in the House.\nAngel Ureña, a spokesperson for Bill Clinton, responded in a post Monday to a letter from House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, saying the Clintons had \"negotiated in good faith\".\nThe Oversight Committee subpoenaed the Clintons in August along with several top former Justice Department officials, including former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, William Barr, Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales; and former FBI Directors James Comey and Robert Mueller requesting testimony “related to the horrific crimes perpetrated by Jeffrey Epstein.”\nBill Clinton has repeatedly denied wrongdoing related to the late convicted sex offender.\nIt was not immediately clear whether Comer would accept the eleventh-hour offer, scuttling a full House vote to hold the Clintons in contempt for their repeated refusals to testify for months.\n“They negotiated in good faith. You did not. They told you under oath what they know, but you don’t care. But the former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone,” Clinton spokesperson said in a defiant X post.\nComer said in a statement Monday evening that he still had questions on the offer.\n“The Clintons’ counsel has said they agree to terms, but those terms lack clarity yet again and they have provided no dates for their depositions. The only reason they have said they agree to terms is because the House has moved forward with contempt,” he said. “I will clarify the terms they are agreeing to and then discuss next steps with my committee members.”\nThe top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, however, said he didn’t see a scenario where the panel’s chairman didn’t accept the offer. The Clintons, he told CNN, had “accepted every single term that has been laid out by Comer.”\n“We’ve said from day one that we wanted Bill Clinton to testify in front of the Oversight Committee. We’ve been repeating that and we’ve been working obviously with their teams. And so, I’m glad they’re going to testify,” Rep. Robert Garcia said.\nJust hours earlier, the Republican chairman, unsatisfied by conditions the Clintons’ legal team sought to place on their cooperation, appeared set to move forward with the contempt proceedings.\n“It has been nearly six months since your clients first received the Committee’s subpoena, more than three months since the original date of their depositions, and nearly three weeks since they failed to appear for their depositions commensurate with the Committee’s lawful subpoenas,” Comer wrote at the time. “Your clients’ desire for special treatment is both frustrating and an affront to the American people’s desire for transparency.”\nRelated Article\nYemen accuses UAE-backed forces of grave human rights violations\nThe House Rules Committee was setting the parameters for such a vote when the latest proposal was made.\nThe offer from the Clintons’ attorney came via email in the middle of a committee meeting as Comer was testifying about the contempt proceedings, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\nLater Monday evening, House Rules Committee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx announced that, given the developments, the panel would hold off on advancing the contempt resolutions. However, she noted that if there is not further progress overnight, they will return to consider them again.\nIt wasn’t the Clintons’ first attempt to avoid proceedings.\nThrough their attorneys, the pair had made multiple offers in recent days, including a four hour in-person voluntary interview in New York, which Comer had rejected earlier Monday.\nAttorneys for the former president and former secretary of state have been in discussion with the Republican-led committee multiple times since lawmakers from both parties voted in January to hold the Clintons in contempt for refusing to appear for in-person depositions as part of the panel’s investigation into Epstein.\nBy rejecting the Clintons’ initial offer, Comer had all but ensured that the House would hold a final vote this week on the contempt resolutions.\nEven though the lawyers continued to push for the panel to drop its subpoena for Hillary Clinton’s testimony, they said she could submit a second sworn declaration or appear for an in-person interview in a similar format to her husband.\nIn exchange, Clinton attorneys Ashley Callen and David E. Kendall had asked Comer to withdraw the subpoenas and contempt resolutions against them.\nComer rejected that offer from the Clintons’ attorneys as “unreasonable” and said he could not accept such terms.\nThe Justice Department on Friday released more than 3.5 million pages’ worth of files related to Epstein, which Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said constituted about half of the more than 6 million relevant documents the Justice Department collected. Much of the released materials were redacted.\nThe first set of Epstein files released by the Justice Department in December included numerous pictures of Bill Clinton, who his spokesperson said had flown on Epstein’s plane for Clinton Foundation trips in the early 2000s, before Epstein was charged with any sex crimes. — Agencies\nThese were the details of the news Clintons agree to testify in Epstein probe ahead of House contempt vote for this day.

The move marked a sharp turn after weeks of public resistance to the committee’s subpoenas, just as recent reporting showed internal GOP tensions on unrelated issues like the ICE shooting in Minneapolis.\nHouse leaders had been preparing for a full vote on Wednesday to hold both Clintons in contempt of Congress.

The Clintons have repeatedly said they had no knowledge of Epstein’s criminal activity, while also arguing that the subpoenas issued to them were invalid because they were not tied to a legitimate legislative purpose. Their actions come as other political figures have faced scrutiny, like Donald Trump suing federal agencies in a $10B suit.\nRepublican lawmakers rejected that claim and characterized the refusal to appear as defiance of congressional authority. Earlier this year, both Clintons skipped scheduled depositions, prompting the committee to begin contempt proceedings.\nIn January, the panel voted on a bipartisan basis to advance contempt measures against both of them. That action cleared the way for the House vote that was scheduled to take place this week.\nThe agreement to testify leaves several questions unresolved.

They also complained the GOP-led push was an attempt to embarrass and put them in jail.\nThey changed their minds after weeks of rising tension, as Republicans on the committee moved toward holding them in contempt of Congress for skipping earlier closed‑door interviews. People involved in the talks say the Clintons decided it wasn’t worth a long, messy fight that could drag on for months and distract from everything else they’re doing. They also see testifying under oath as a way to directly push back on what they consider exaggerated or misleading claims about their ties to Epstein, and to lay out their side of the story in a more controlled setting.\nRepublicans, led by Chair James Comer, argue that hearing from the Clintons is important to finishing the committee’s public look at Epstein’s network and his links to powerful people. From the Clintons’ perspective, showing up is a way to lower the temperature of a very public standoff with Congress and signal that they’re willing to answer questions, even as they continue to say the investigation has been heavily shaped by partisan politics."

While the existence of these flights has been a subject of public scrutiny for years, the latest batch of documents—part of a massive three-million-page trove—provides specific timestamps, passenger manifests, and destination details previously kept under seal.\nCharitable Missions vs. Personal Ties The records indicate that the 16 flights took place between 2002 and 2003, shortly after Clinton left the White House. Destinations included international locations such as London, Hong Kong, and several countries in Africa.\nRepresentatives for the former president have long maintained that these trips were strictly related to the work of the Clinton Foundation and its global health initiatives. Clinton’s office has previously stated that the former president had \"no knowledge\" of Epstein's crimes and emphasized that he never visited Epstein’s private island, Little St. James. However, the newly released files have reignited intense public interest as journalists and legal experts pore over the details to determine if any unrecorded stops occurred.\nNo Accusations of Wrongdoing Justice Department officials noted that while Clinton’s name appears frequently in these logs, the documents released so far do not contain evidence of illegal conduct by the former president.

Analysts review found much of it focused on travel and dining planning, including messages about last-minute invitations.\nIn one April 2003 email, Maxwell wrote to a redacted Clinton office address: “Glad you are coming to the dinner - JE says do you think CLinton would like to come - let me know.”\nA December 2001 exchange shows a Clinton staffer asking Maxwell for Prince Andrew’s phone number to set up a golf outing during a Scotland trip. Maxwell replied, “Just spoke to Andrew. He is not currently in Scotland but is going to m. He says if I give him a no. he will ring Clinton. Doug, do you want him to call you ?”\nThe files also include flirtatious and explicit language. Maxwell wrote in one exchange that she told a tabloid what “supper stud you are and how I have a crush on you and how you are hung like a horse and- well you get the picture. Hope you don’t mind!” Another 2002 email from a Clinton-linked address read: “Went home with someone I have before, a 40 year old blonde big boobby widow if you can believe that.

      "text": "A newly released set of Epstein-related documents has surfaced an FBI interview containing deeply disturbing allegations involving former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, as well as references to Donald Trump.\nThe claims appear in a transcript of an FBI interview conducted in August 2019 and form part of a broader document release tied to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The allegations are graphic, unverified, and explicitly flagged by authorities as unsupported by corroborating evidence.\nWhat follows is a careful explanation of what the documents contain, how the FBI assessed the claims, and why the context matters.\nWhat Do the Newly Released Epstein Files Contain?\nThe latest tranche of Epstein files includes emails, interview transcripts, and internal notes released following court orders and transparency mandates. Among them is an FBI interview with an individual identified as a victim who described alleged abuse dating back decades.\nThese records reflect information received by investigators rather than conclusions reached by law enforcement. The FBI routinely documents allegations, even when they are later deemed unreliable or unsubstantiated.\nWhat Does the FBI Interview Allege?\nAccording to the interview transcript dated August 27, 2019, the interviewee alleged that he was sexually assaulted aboard a yacht around the year 2000. The interview references Jeffrey Epstein and names Bill Clinton as a participant in the alleged abuse. George W. Bush is also named in the broader set of claims. Donald Trump is mentioned as being present on the trip, according to the interviewee.\nThe interviewee stated that he was in a heavily drug-induced state during the alleged incident. He also described extreme and violent imagery that investigators recorded verbatim but did not verify.\nHow Did the FBI Assess These Claims?\nThe transcript itself makes clear that the interviewee did not provide corroborating evidence to support his allegations.\nAccording to the document:\n- The claims were based on what the interviewee described as recovered or repressed memories\n- He acknowledged extensive past drug use\n- The FBI noted concerns about his emotional stability\n- Investigators did not expand the inquiry or pursue charges\nThe FBI recorded that, at the time of the interview, the individual was not intoxicated, but agents expressed skepticism regarding the reliability of the account.\nThis distinction is crucial. FBI interviews are records of what someone said, not determinations of fact.\nWho Brought the Interviewee to the FBI?\nThe documents state that the interviewee was brought to the FBI by Michael Moore, who is described in the file as a controversial figure and has been characterized by critics as promoting conspiracy-driven narratives.\nThe presence of a third party does not invalidate a claim, but it is part of the context investigators consider when assessing credibility.\nAre There Any Charges or Findings Against the Named Figures?\nNo.\nThere are:\n- No indictments\n- No corroborating witness statements\n- No physical or documentary evidence was cited in the file\n- No follow-up investigation was disclosed in the released material\nNeither Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, nor Donald Trump has been charged in relation to the allegations described in this interview.\nLegal experts consistently warn against equating inclusion in raw investigative records with proof of wrongdoing.\nWhy Are These Allegations Drawing Attention Now?\nThe Epstein case remains uniquely sensitive because of Epstein’s documented access to powerful people and his history of sexual crimes. Each new document release tends to generate renewed scrutiny, even when the material consists of unverified or previously assessed claims.\nPublic interest is heightened when prominent political figures are named, regardless of whether the claims have evidentiary support.\nThe Broader Pattern in Epstein Document Releases\nThis episode reflects a recurring issue with large-scale transparency efforts.\nThey often include:\n- Raw allegations recorded without validation\n- Claims investigators chose not to pursue\n- Graphic descriptions preserved for completeness, not confirmation\nWithout context, such material can easily be misread as fact.\nResponsible reporting requires making clear distinctions between allegations, evidence, and legal outcomes.\nWhy Context Matters in Reporting Epstein-Related Claims\nSexual abuse allegations deserve to be taken seriously. At the same time, accusations—especially those involving public figures—require corroboration to meet legal and journalistic standards.\nIn this case:\n- The FBI documented the claims\n- The FBI did not substantiate them\n- No legal action followed\nThose facts are as important as the allegations themselves.\nTL;DR\nA newly released Epstein file includes an FBI interview from 2019 containing graphic allegations involving Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and mentions of Donald Trump. The claims were unverified, unsupported by evidence, and not pursued by investigators. The FBI recorded credibility concerns about the interviewee and did not expand the investigation. No charges have been filed against any of the named individuals."
